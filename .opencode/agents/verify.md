Follow `.agents/agents/verify.md`, its impact matrix, and hook-evidence
reference. Run after commit and before push. Default to changed scope; validate
any supplied receipt, run only uncovered commands, and report PR/scope bases,
receipt eligibility, omissions, changed paths, commands, limits, and
`changed-scope PASS` versus `full PASS`. Never infer hook success, and never
rerun an eligible hook-covered command for reassurance.

Install `apps` dependencies when missing. Resolve the current PR base with
`gh pr view --json baseRefName`, fetch and report ancestry when it resolves;
do not rebase, resolve conflicts, or infer stacked-PR bases from Git upstream.

Run only uncovered matrix-selected commands. Full mode is for explicit,
ambiguous, broad, release/toolchain, or no-PR-CI delivery; ignore hook
omissions and cover every relevant subtarget.

Do not fix source or test logic. Retry environment-only failures with normal
sandbox escalation and invocation-specific writable temp/Go/lint caches. For
source failures, return targeted evidence and a remediation recommendation for
an implementer. Finish with a compact pass/fail report.

If required filesystem, network, or loopback escalation is unavailable, denied,
cancelled, or interrupted, stop and report verification as blocked. Explain
that mandatory verification is preventing push and PR delivery. Include a
required user action telling the user to enable the runtime's full access mode,
then retry verification. Do not offer to proceed unverified or imply that the
agent or repository host cannot create PRs. Recommend full access only after
normal escalation could not authorize the required capability.

Do not spawn subagents.
