# Executor system

## Purpose

The executor system owns the runtime environments that execute agent work,
including local, container, and SSH execution boundaries.

## Ownership

This system owns executor profiles, environment construction, SSH lifecycle,
runtime resource admission, process and port safety, agent process lifetime
across a backend restart, and executor-specific failure and recovery contracts.

## Exclusions

- Agent identity and provider capabilities belong to the [agent
  system](../agents/README.md).
- Task ownership of worktrees belongs to the [task system](../tasks/README.md).
- Desktop process supervision belongs to the [desktop system](../desktop/README.md).

## Migration record

Migration remains in progress while legacy source detail is extracted from the
canonical requirement and system-design documents. Use the catalog command to
find current sources.

The [Kubernetes executor foundation](../kubernetes-executor/spec.md) remains
the shipped lifecycle contract. Kubernetes capability pairs extend it. The
[task-pod requirements](requirements/kubernetes-task-pod.md) and
[design](system-design/kubernetes-task-pod.md) define task-owned compute and
replace session ownership. Other foundation
security, admission, and recovery guarantees remain applicable.

## Related systems

- [Agents](../agents/README.md): supplies the agent command and profile.
- [Tasks](../tasks/README.md): owns task-scoped execution lifecycle.

The compact task indicator contract is extracted into
[requirements](requirements/task-status-indicators.md) and
[design](system-design/task-status-indicators.md), including automatic freshness
and desktop/touch disclosure. The foundation retains task-page controls.
