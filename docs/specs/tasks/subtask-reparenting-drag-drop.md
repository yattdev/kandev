# Subtask re-parenting by drag and drop

## Why

Users can detach a subtask or nest a task under another via context-menu actions, but moving a task from under one parent to under another takes two menu hops (un-nest, then nest under), and the sidebar's drag-and-drop only reorders siblings. A direct drag gesture should re-parent a task in one motion with the exact same result as those two menu actions.

## What

- The sidebar task tree (desktop sidebar and the mobile task switcher sheet) lets a user re-parent a task by dragging its row onto another row's **nest drop zone**.
- The result is strictly equivalent to choosing `Un-nest (remove parent)` then `Nest under <target>` from the task's context menu: the task's parent becomes the target, and a task whose workspace mode is `inherit_parent` ends with mode `shared_group` — its materialized workspace and workspace-group membership are unchanged.
- Drop targets are exactly the candidates the context menu offers (the `computeNestCandidates` rules): same-workflow root tasks in the visible group, excluding the dragged task, its current parent, and any subtask (which also excludes the task's own descendants). A task that already has children offers no nest targets.
- While a drag with valid targets is active, candidate rows show a nest drop zone (a left-edge strip) with a `Nest under <title>` affordance. Dropping on a zone re-parents; dropping between rows keeps the existing sibling-reorder behavior; any other drop is a no-op.
- Re-parenting is a single API call on the existing canonical path (`PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:id` with `parent_id`), which already rejects self-parenting, missing/archived/cross-workspace targets, descendant cycles, and one-level-depth violations for kanban tasks.
- The sidebar `Nest under` menu, the Office parent picker, the WS task-update path, and the Office dashboard PATCH all share the same composite semantics: any effective parent change normalizes an `inherit_parent` workspace mode to `shared_group`.
- No confirmation dialog is shown on drop (unlike the detach menu action): the gesture is explicit, the operation is non-destructive (workspace membership is retained) and reversible via the menu or another drag.
- Successful re-parenting is reflected across sidebar, board, and task-detail views without a reload, via the existing optimistic snapshot update and the `task.updated` WebSocket event.
- The mobile task switcher sheet offers the same touch drag-and-drop re-parenting.

## Data model

No table or column is added. Re-parenting updates existing persisted fields in the same task-row write:

- `tasks.parent_id` becomes the target task's id (the previous parent, if any, is replaced).
- `tasks.metadata.workspace.mode` changes from `inherit_parent` to `shared_group` when the parent relationship effectively changes and the mode was `inherit_parent`. Other modes (`shared_group`, `new_workspace`) are unchanged.
- `task_workspace_group_members` is unchanged; active membership remains the durable source of shared workspace access.
- Descendant `parent_id` values, blockers, sessions, repositories, workflow, workflow step, and state are unchanged.

## API surface

No new endpoint. Reuses and extends existing contracts:

- `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:id` with `parent_id` (non-empty nests; `""` un-nests) — already validated by `Service.resolveParentID` (self, existence, archived, same workspace, descendant cycle) and `validateReparentDepth` (one-level kanban limit, Office trees exempt). **Behavior addition:** when the effective parent changes, `inherit_parent` workspace mode is normalized to `shared_group` (mirroring the detach operation). Success returns the updated task DTO; invalid targets map to `400`; missing task to `404`.
- `PATCH /api/v1/office/tasks/:id` with non-empty `parent_id` — same normalization added for parity; empty parent continues to route through the canonical detach operation.
- WS `task.updated` payload unchanged: `parent_id` is always present (nil when cleared), and `metadata` carries the normalized workspace mode.

## Failure modes

- **Invalid target** (self, descendant, subtask, archived, missing, cross-workspace, or depth violation): the UI filters these targets out before a drop can land, so a drop outside every nest zone is a no-op. If a request is nevertheless rejected by the backend (e.g. a valid-zone target became invalid between render and drop), the UI keeps the task in its original tree position, rolls back the optimistic update, and shows a request-error toast.
- **Persistence failure**: no successful response is returned; the UI rolls back to the original tree.
- **Concurrent submissions** are safe: setting the same parent twice is idempotent, and the optimistic update is reconciled by the authoritative `task.updated` event.
- **No valid targets**: the drag offers no nest zones; only reorder remains possible.

## Scenarios

- **GIVEN** a subtask `C` under parent `A` and a root task `B` in the same workflow, **WHEN** the user drags `C` onto `B`'s nest drop zone, **THEN** `C`'s parent becomes `B`, the sidebar shows `C` nested under `B`, and no reload occurs.
- **GIVEN** an `inherit_parent` subtask `C` under `A`, **WHEN** `C` is dragged onto root `B`'s nest zone, **THEN** `C`'s persisted workspace mode is `shared_group` and its workspace-group membership is unchanged.
- **GIVEN** a root task with no children, **WHEN** it is dragged onto another root's nest zone, **THEN** it becomes that root's subtask.
- **GIVEN** a task that already has children, **WHEN** it is dragged, **THEN** no row offers a nest drop zone (reorder only).
- **GIVEN** a drag over a subtask row or over a task in a different workflow, **WHEN** the pointer rests on the row, **THEN** no nest drop zone is offered.
- **GIVEN** a subtask dragged toward its current parent, **WHEN** the pointer rests on that parent row, **THEN** no nest drop zone is offered.
- **GIVEN** a drag dropped between two sibling rows, **WHEN** the drop lands outside every nest zone, **THEN** the siblings reorder as before.
- **GIVEN** a drop that lands outside every nest zone, **WHEN** the drop completes, **THEN** the task keeps its original parent and no request is sent (a plain no-op); a request-error toast appears only when a valid-zone drop's request is rejected by the backend.
- **GIVEN** a re-parented task, **WHEN** its `task.updated` event arrives over WebSocket, **THEN** cached parent relationships in sidebar, board, and task-detail views are updated.
- **GIVEN** the mobile task switcher sheet, **WHEN** a user touch-drags a subtask onto a root's nest zone, **THEN** the same re-parenting occurs.

## Out of scope

- Nesting via drag on the kanban board (cards keep their step-move drag semantics).
- Lifting the one-level kanban subtask limit (still enforced by `computeNestCandidates` and `validateReparentDepth`; Office trees keep arbitrary depth).
- Drag-to-re-parent in the Office task list (Office keeps its parent picker).
- Bulk or multi-select drag re-parenting.
- A keyboard/AT drag gesture; the existing context menus remain the accessible path to the same operation.
