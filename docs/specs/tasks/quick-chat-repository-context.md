# Quick Chat Repository Context

## Why

Quick chat is useful for focused questions, but its agent-only picker does not explain the
surface or let a user ground the conversation in repository code. Users need optional code
context without changing their checked-out branches or creating a kanban task.

## What

- A new quick chat presents a searchable agent-profile selector and requires an agent before
  it can start.
- A user may add zero, one, or multiple imported workspace repositories. Each selected
  repository has one explicit base branch and can appear at most once in a chat.
- Selecting a repository automatically fills its preferred branch (`main`, `master`, or the
  first available branch), including when another repository lookup is still pending.
- A workspace with no existing quick chats explains that quick chat is for discussing an idea,
  question, or codebase outside the task board.
- Agent and repository fields include concise helper copy. Repository copy explains that the
  optional selection focuses the conversation on specific code and branches.
- Repo-backed quick chats run in Kandev-owned isolated worktrees. They never switch or modify
  the branch checked out in the user's source directory.
- Repository context contains committed branch state. Uncommitted files from the user's
  working directory are not copied into the chat.
- Repo-less quick chats retain their current scratch workspace and default-executor behavior.
- The desktop quick-chat dialog stays horizontally centered and can be resized from either
  horizontal edge. Its last user-selected width is restored across browser sessions and clamped
  to the current viewport.
- The quick-chat message history and composer retain the dialog's popover surface color. The setup
  footer uses that same continuous surface, and the new chat action appears immediately after the
  last chat tab.
- Quick-chat tabs remain in creation order across reloads; later activity does not reorder them.
- Hovering either resize target highlights the dialog's outer border, not an inset line.
- The setup flow supports desktop and mobile layouts without horizontal page scrolling or
  hover-only actions. Mobile quick chat remains full-screen and does not expose resize handles.

Decision: [ADR 0038](../../decisions/0038-quick-chat-repository-isolation.md).

## API surface

`POST /api/v1/workspaces/:id/quick-chat` accepts:

```json
{
  "title": "Codex - Chat 1",
  "agent_profile_id": "profile-id",
  "repositories": [
    { "repository_id": "repo-1", "base_branch": "main" },
    { "repository_id": "repo-2", "base_branch": "develop" }
  ]
}
```

`agent_profile_id` is required after workspace-default resolution. `repositories` is optional
and ordered. The legacy singleton repository fields remain accepted, but callers cannot mix
the singleton and plural shapes in one request.

The response remains:

```json
{ "task_id": "task-id", "session_id": "session-id" }
```

## Failure modes

- An incomplete repository row keeps Start Chat disabled.
- A missing agent, foreign repository, duplicate repository, invalid branch, or mixed request
  shape fails validation and does not launch an agent.
- If repository preparation or agent launch fails, the backend deletes the ephemeral task and
  its materialized worktrees. The setup remains visible with its selections and reports the
  error.
- A superseded in-flight start still deletes the completed orphan task.

## Persistence guarantees

Quick-chat task/session rows and their isolated worktrees survive backend restarts under the
existing task runtime rules. Closing, deleting, workspace deletion, or idle expiration cleans
them through the existing quick-chat task deletion path.

## Scenarios

- **GIVEN** a workspace with no quick chats, **WHEN** the user opens Quick Chat, **THEN** the
  setup explains its purpose and shows agent and repository helper copy.
- **GIVEN** an agent and no repositories, **WHEN** the user starts a chat, **THEN** the chat uses
  the existing repo-less scratch workspace.
- **GIVEN** an agent and two repository/branch selections, **WHEN** the user starts a chat,
  **THEN** the agent workspace contains both repositories at committed state from those branches.
- **GIVEN** a repository with an empty branch selection, **WHEN** its branch list loads, **THEN**
  the preferred branch is selected automatically even if a prior repository request is pending.
- **GIVEN** the user's source checkout is on another branch or dirty, **WHEN** a repo-backed chat
  starts, **THEN** the source checkout and its uncommitted files remain unchanged.
- **GIVEN** one repo-backed chat is active, **WHEN** another chat targets the same repository and
  base branch, **THEN** both start in distinct Kandev-owned worktrees.
- **GIVEN** an existing quick chat, **WHEN** the user opens a new chat tab, **THEN** the long
  first-use introduction is omitted while field helper copy remains.
- **GIVEN** a mobile viewport, **WHEN** the user selects an agent and repository branch, **THEN**
  all controls remain touch-accessible and the page has no horizontal overflow.
- **GIVEN** a desktop quick-chat dialog, **WHEN** the user drags either horizontal edge, **THEN**
  the centered dialog resizes within viewport limits and restores that width the next time it
  opens.
- **GIVEN** one or more quick-chat tabs, **WHEN** the tab strip renders, **THEN** the new-chat
  action sits directly after the final tab rather than at the far edge of the dialog.

## Out of scope

- Remote repository URL entry or arbitrary local folders.
- Including uncommitted working-directory changes.
- Selecting the same repository more than once in a single quick chat.
- Choosing an executor in the quick-chat setup.
