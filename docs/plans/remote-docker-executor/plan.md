# Implementation Plan: Remote Docker Executor

## Overview

Replace the `remote_docker` stub with a working runtime that provisions task
containers on a Docker daemon reached over SSH. The work composes the existing
Docker container model with the existing SSH transport rather than writing a
third remote runtime.

## Scope

### In scope

- An SSH-dialed Docker client and profile-owned daemon connection.
- Removal of the three backend-host couplings: bind-mount sources, `agentctl`
  delivery, and published-port reachability.
- A test-then-trust profile create flow with distinct probe steps.
- Resume, stop, reset, archive, and delete against a remote daemon.
- A `containers`-project E2E scenario over the existing sshd fixture.
- Public executor documentation replacing the "Not implemented" row.

### Out of scope

- A `tcp://` transport, per `AC-EXECUTORS-REMOTE-DOCKER-001.3`.
- Any change to `local_docker` behavior or the executor enum.
- Docker context files, daemon provisioning, or remote host bootstrap beyond
  the `agentctl` helper.
- Sharing one pooled SSH connection between `ssh` and `remote_docker` profiles.

## Dependency order

```text
wave 1: task-01 (client)  task-02 (host files)  task-03 (endpoints)
wave 2: task-04 (runtime)
wave 3: task-05 (profile UI + test endpoint)
wave 4: task-06 (E2E + docs)  task-07 (environment dispatch)
```

Tasks 01, 02, and 03 touch disjoint files and are parallel-safe. Task 04
composes all three and cannot start before they land. Task 05 depends on the
probe surface task 04 exposes. Task 06 validates the whole.

## Work orders

| Task | Title | Wave | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | [SSH-dialed Docker client](task-01-ssh-dialed-docker-client.md) | 1 | none |
| 02 | [Container host-file provider](task-02-container-host-file-provider.md) | 1 | none |
| 03 | [Container endpoint resolver](task-03-container-endpoint-resolver.md) | 1 | none |
| 04 | [Remote Docker runtime](task-04-remote-docker-runtime.md) | 2 | 01, 02, 03 |
| 05 | [Profile create flow and connection test](task-05-profile-create-and-test.md) | 3 | 04 |
| 06 | [E2E scenario and public documentation](task-06-e2e-and-docs.md) | 4 | 05 |
| 07 | [Route environment status and teardown to the owning executor](task-07-environment-layer-executor-dispatch.md) | 4 | 04 |

## Verification

Per work order, plus a final package check:

```bash
# From apps/backend:
rtk make test lint
# From apps/web:
rtk pnpm run typecheck && rtk pnpm --filter @kandev/web lint
KANDEV_E2E_CONTAINERS=1 rtk pnpm run e2e --project=containers --grep "remote docker"
```

## Branch-review rework

An independent review of the branch raised seven findings. All were verified
against the code and confirmed; all are now addressed.

1. No reconnect path and stop released the only SSH session (task 04).
2. No transport watchdog on live sessions (task 04).
3. `LocalClonePath` forwarded to a remote daemon (task 04).
4. Generic executor and profile mutations stayed member-accessible, so only
   the bespoke routes were gated (task 05).
5. Saved profiles had no retest path and no effective-root notice (task 05).
6. Package statuses claimed completion while task 04 was still `pending` and
   task 06 recorded a missing scenario. Corrected rather than argued: the
   statuses were wrong, not the finding.
7. The build stream ignored scanner errors, so a truncated log read as a
   successful build (task 06).

## Risks

- The `WithHost` then `WithDialContext` option order is load-bearing;
  `sockets.ConfigureTransport` installs a TCP dialer that silently wins if the
  order is reversed. Task 01 pins this with a test.
- `docker system dial-stdio` requires the SSH user to reach the Docker socket.
  This is the most likely first-run failure and must be a named cause, not a
  generic daemon error.
- The published instance-port range is 100 ports; a forward is created per
  instance port actually used, not eagerly for the range.
- The current container manager always selects the `linux/amd64` `agentctl`
  helper. Remote hosts make this visible; task 02 must select by probed
  platform.
- E2E needs a Docker daemon reachable over the sshd fixture. If nesting a
  daemon in the existing container proves unstable, the scenario may need a
  separate compose fixture; this is the least certain estimate in the plan.
