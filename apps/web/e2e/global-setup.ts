/**
 * Fail fast when the coverage oracle is asked to run against a bundle that has
 * no pseudo catalog.
 *
 * A production `vite build` deliberately drops it (see lib/i18n/bundling.ts).
 * Run tests/i18n/pseudo-coverage.spec.ts against such a bundle and every screen
 * falls back to `en` — so all ten tests fail with a wall of findings that reads
 * exactly like a mass externalization regression, when the real cause is that
 * the artifact was built with `make build-web` instead of `make build-web-e2e`.
 * Only checked under KANDEV_I18N_COVERAGE=1; nothing else needs the catalog.
 *
 * The markers are read from the catalogs themselves rather than hardcoded, so
 * this cannot drift as `pnpm run i18n:pseudo` regenerates them — and the whole
 * SOURCE directory is scanned rather than one named file, so adding, renaming or
 * splitting a namespace cannot quietly turn the check into a no-op. Every path
 * out of here either throws or has actually compared markers against `dist/`: a
 * guard that can only ever pass is worth less than no guard, because it also
 * reports clean.
