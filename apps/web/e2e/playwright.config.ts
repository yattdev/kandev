  // vary from 1 to 30+ tests. Test-level sharding flattens that distribution.
  //
  // Concurrency is still capped by `workers: 1` below — only one test runs at a

  // backend). `fullyParallel: true` alone does not introduce intra-shard
  // parallelism unless workers > 1.

  // Playwright project (see below) so the worker-scoped backend env
  // (KANDEV_MOCK_PROVIDERS, KANDEV_PROVIDER_FAILURES) that those specs
  // restart with cannot leak into specs that count agents or read the
  // topbar agent name. Each routing spec restarts the backend back to
  // baseline in `afterAll` (see backend.restart() — no args = revert to
