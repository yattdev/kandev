/**
 * Regression: when workspace preparation takes longer than the file-tree
 * retry budget (~18s), the right-sidebar file tree and terminal must keep
 * waiting instead of giving up. We simulate a slow workspace prepare by
 * writing a delay file that the backend fixture's `git` shim reads — so
 * `git fetch` inside the worktree preparer blocks for N seconds, which
 * serialises agentctl readiness behind it (same ordering that a real slow
 * git pull on a big monorepo would produce).
