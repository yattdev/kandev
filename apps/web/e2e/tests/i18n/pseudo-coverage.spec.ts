/**
 * Pseudo-locale coverage oracle.
 *
 * Under the pseudo-locale every EXTRACTED message is accented
 * (`Language` → `Ĺàńĝũàĝē`). So any user-facing copy that is still plain ASCII
 * is, by definition, a string that was never wrapped in a Lingui macro. This
 * spec crawls chrome-heavy screens and reports those leftovers.
 *
 * It runs TWO passes, because copy reaches the user by two routes:
 *   - visible text nodes, and
 *   - `COPY_ATTRIBUTES` — the copy a screen-reader user receives and a sighted
 *     one never sees. That pass is why the oracle is no longer blind to an
 *     `aria-label` that was never externalized; see docs/i18n.md.
 *
 * `SCREENS` mirrors `i18nGuardFiles` in eslint.i18n.options.mjs: a screen belongs
 * here once the components that render it have been migrated. The eslint guard
 * only sees plain literals in JSX, so it and this spec cover different halves of
 * the same question — add to both in the PR that migrates a directory.
 *
 * THIS IS A HARD CI GATE. It ran behind `KANDEV_I18N_COVERAGE=1` only while the
 * migration was mid-flight, because a screen's own copy could be clean while
 * shared chrome it renders was not yet. The last live directory has landed and
 * the env guard is gone: it now runs unconditionally in the `chromium` project
 * alongside every other spec.
 *
 *   pnpm e2e:raw -- e2e/tests/i18n/pseudo-coverage.spec.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT GUARANTEES: on each screen in `SCREENS`, every rendered text node and
 * every value of a `COPY_ATTRIBUTES` attribute that the detector below can see
 * either came through `t()` / `<Trans>` (and so renders accented under the
 * pseudo-locale), or is on an allowlist that says why it must not be translated.
 *
 * That guarantee rests on the scan having run against the screen it names, which
 * for a while it did not. Each `SCREENS` entry carries a required `anchor` — a
 * selector that cannot match until that route rendered — and `waitForScreen`
 * blocks on it before anything is inspected. Read its comment before touching
 * the readiness logic: the wait it replaced was a one-second settle, and with
 * both lazy route chunks blocked so that NO screen rendered, 13-16 of the 21
 * tests still reported clean.
 *
 * It is a floor, not a proof of total coverage. Two limits are deliberate and
 * both are documented where they are implemented, because relaxing either
 * reddens every screen today:
 *   - `wordlike` requires a 4-letter ASCII run, so a hardcoded string shorter
 *     than that ("Add", "of") is not reported. Lowering it to 2 was measured:
 *     9 of the 10 tests here go red, on real but out-of-scope copy owned by
 *     `@kandev/ui` and sonner (e.g. the `alt+T` in sonner's toast-region label).
 *   - the text pass clears a node on ANY accented character, so an un-migrated
 *     word sharing one text node with migrated copy is missed. The attribute
 *     pass does NOT have this limit — it strips allowlisted tokens first and
 *     reports the remainder as `English frame, migrated value`. docs/i18n.md
 *     covers the text-node case under "…and it is weakest at an interpolated
 *     value"; it is why the by-hand pseudo walk is still step 9 of a migration.
 *
 * IF YOUR PR JUST WENT RED HERE, the failure names the exact strings and the
 * screen. Read them: each one is copy your change put on screen without routing
 * it through `t()`. This spec is the ONLY gate that can see most of them —
 * `i18next/no-literal-string` inspects literals in JSX and nothing else, so copy
 * in a variable, a default parameter, a `.ts` helper or a SCREAMING_CASE config
 * table is invisible to lint and visible only here. Repeated by-hand sweeps
 * found 15-60 such strings that every other gate passed.
 *
 * The fix is to externalize the string: add it to `src/locales/en/<ns>.json` and
 * call `t("<ns>:<key>")`. See docs/i18n.md. Adding an `allow:` entry is NOT the
 * fix and is the one failure mode this file has actually shipped twice — an
 * entry asserting a path was migrated while it still rendered English. `allow`
 * is for text the frontend must not translate but cannot avoid rendering (a
 * backend-owned record, a product name), and it must say where the value comes
 * from.
 *
 * BOTH passes walk `document.body`, deliberately, and NOT the page's `<main>`.
 * Scoping to the page under test is the obvious reading of what each test claims,
 * and it was tried and rejected on one fact: `@kandev/ui` builds Dialog,
 * AlertDialog, DropdownMenu, Tooltip and Select on Radix `Portal`, which mounts
 * to `document.body`. Every dialog, menu and tooltip in the app therefore renders
 * OUTSIDE `<main>`, so a scoped walk would stop checking the surfaces densest in
 * copy — and would do it silently, reporting clean. Trading a visible annoyance
 * for an invisible blind spot is the wrong direction for an oracle whose whole
 * purpose is the strings nothing else can see.
 *
 * The cost of body-wide is that a screen can fail for chrome it does not own.
 * That cost is now small — migrating the sidebar, settings nav and status bar
 * (#2214) took the baseline from 28 findings to 5 — and it buys the one thing
 * nothing else has: copy that belongs to no directory, like `@kandev/ui`'s
 * hardcoded breadcrumb landmark and sonner's toast-container label, is visible
 * only because the walk is body-wide. The fix for chrome noise is migrating
 * chrome, not narrowing the oracle.

   * A selector that cannot match until the ROUTE UNDER TEST has rendered. The
   * walk does not start until it matches AND the matched element's text is
   * accented.
   *
   * The test it must pass is not "is it unique" but "could the app shell alone
   * satisfy it?". `secrets-settings-body` also renders on the workspace-scoped
   * secrets page, and that is fine — reaching it still proves a secrets screen
   * mounted. What disqualifies a selector is matching something painted before
   * the route arrives, which is exactly the bug this field fixes.
   *
   * The two route trees answer that differently, and the difference is real
   * rather than an inconsistency to tidy up:
   *
   *   - SETTINGS screens anchor on a `data-testid` the page's own component
   *     renders. Seven already had one; `secrets-settings-body` and
   *     `sprites-connection-card` were added alongside this field.
   *   - OFFICE screens anchor on `main[data-office-route="<path>"]`, the route
   *     outlet in src/office-routes.tsx stamped with the RESOLVED path. A
   *     component-level testid was tried and rejected: the SPA route table
   *     mounts these pages with empty collections (`initialItems={[]}`), so they
   *     legitimately render empty states in e2e and any anchor inside the
   *     populated branch would never match. The outlet is present whichever
   *     branch a page takes, lives inside the office chunk, is absent while
   *     `OfficeRouteLoading` holds, and — because the selector pins the VALUE —
   *     cannot be satisfied by a different office route or by the unknown-route
   *     fallback.
   *
   * Note what carries the weight in the Office case: the element is generic, so
   * the ACCENTED half of `waitForScreen` is what proves a page actually painted
   * into it. An empty outlet has no accented text and times out.
   *
   * An attribute and not a heading name, deliberately, in both trees: the anchor
   * has to be findable BEFORE the pseudo catalog is known to have applied, and
   * every accessible name in the app changes under pseudo.

  // migration owns.
  //
  // What still blocks these five entries is the shared integration chrome, not
  // the nav. `components/integrations/**` is now migrated, which cleared
  // `drafted-integration-enabled-control.tsx` ("Enabled"/"Disabled"),
  // `auth-status-banner.tsx` ("Authenticated", "· checked <relative>") and the
  // watcher card's loading state. What is left is

  // (`lib/settings/external-mcp-tools.ts`), which is a `.ts` module no lint rule
  // inspects. The collapsed tools preview, the utility agent dialog and the
  // inference status note were scanned separately, since this spec only sees
  // what a route renders on load.
  //
  // #2214 migrated the settings nav, which was the original blocker, and these
  // four now come back clean of it. What still stops them being entries here is
  // copy none of them owns:
  //   - `aria-label="breadcrumb"` from `@kandev/ui`'s Breadcrumb primitive, and
  //     Sonner's `Notifications alt+T` toast-region label. Both are the shared-UI
  //     case docs/i18n.md describes: they need a strings-provider seam in the
  //     package, not a per-route fix.
  //   - `Configuration Chat` from `components/config-chat/`, not yet migrated.
  // Allowlisting either here would hide misses belonging to whoever owns them,
  // which is the failure this list's own comment warns about. The workspace
  // names these routes also surfaced are no longer among them: #2220 derives
  // them from the boot payload and makes them ineligible, which is the right
  // fix — they are user data, and listing them by value would have fixed the
  // fixture and left every developer's own instance broken.
  //
  // Each route also renders data that is correctly English and would need an
  // `allow` entry: the built-in prompts' names and bodies and the built-in
  // utility agents' names and descriptions (both backend-authored), the agent
  // product names and config paths on External MCP, and `Ctrl+Shift+M`.

  // remains is that the route renders the workspace's own name and its
  // workflow/step names — user data, on the same footing as the fixture's
  // "E2E Workspace". Adding the entry needs `findUnlocalizedText` to stop

 * Block until the SCREEN UNDER TEST has rendered under the pseudo locale.

 * This replaces a `waitForTimeout(1_000)` settle, and the reason is the only
 * thing in this file worth reading twice: THE SETTLE LET THE ORACLE REPORT A
 * PASS IT HAD NOT EARNED, and it did so in the direction that hurts.
 *
 * `SCREENS` are lazy routes in two separate chunks — `settings-routes` (2.8 MB)
 * and `office-routes`. Nothing in the old wait was tied to either arriving:
 *   - `activatePseudo`'s `lang="pseudo"` assertion is written server-side by
 *     shell.go before a single script runs, so it is true immediately;
 *   - the `inspectedAttributes > 0` control below is satisfied by the sidebar,
 *     topbar and status bar, which are accented long before the route renders;
 *   - so the only thing standing between "route rendered" and "scan the DOM"
 *     was one second of wall clock.
 * Measured with BOTH chunks blocked outright, so that not one screen rendered:
 * 13-16 of the 21 tests reported clean, varying run to run — because whether a
 * screen "passed" came down to a race the settle could not see. The failure mode
 * is worse than flakiness — under CI load a slow render makes a green result
 * MORE likely, so the gate is at its most permissive exactly when the tree is
 * most likely to be broken. With the anchors below the same probe fails all 21,
 * every run.
 *
 * The fix has to be per-screen. Any signal generic enough to share is a signal
 * the app shell already satisfies, which is how this happened in the first
 * place. So each screen names a selector nothing but that route can satisfy, and
 * this waits on two facts about it:
 *   1. it is VISIBLE — the lazy route mounted and this screen, specifically, is
 *      the one on screen;
 *   2. its text is ACCENTED — the pseudo catalog has actually been applied to
 *      copy this route owns. This was written as insurance against a catalog
 *      that arrives asynchronously; it stopped being hypothetical the moment
 *      lazy catalog loading landed, and `pseudo` is now a fetched chunk like
 *      every locale but `en`. Without it the walk could run against a route
 *      rendered in English fallback and report every string on it as a miss.
 *      Waiting here is robust to that without weakening anything: a wait can
 *      only delay the scan, never excuse a finding.
 *
 * Both are `expect` assertions, not `waitFor`s, so an anchor that never arrives
 * FAILS this spec instead of quietly scanning whatever the shell had painted.
 * That is the whole point: the gate has to be capable of going red.
 *
 * Do NOT be tempted to swap this for `waitForLoadState("networkidle")`. Kandev
 * holds a live WebSocket for the session stream, so the network is never idle
 * and it would hang until timeout — it looks like a stronger wait and is not a
 * wait at all.

 * Attributes that carry display copy rather than a value the app compares.

 * so the guard and this oracle answer the same question about the same set: on an
 * allowlisted path lint flags the literal, and here it is checked at render.
 *
 * `aria-labelledby` / `aria-describedby` / `aria-controls` are deliberately
 * absent — they carry element ids, not prose, and are excluded by the guard too.
 *
 * `title` is checked on EVERY element, not just interactive ones. A `title` is
 * exposed as an accessible name or description whatever the element is, and the
 * browser renders its native tooltip on hover for any of them — so "the app never
 * shows this one" is not true of a rendered `title`. Restricting it to
 * interactive elements would need a tag/role/tabindex heuristic, and that
 * heuristic would immediately become the place attribute copy hides. The guard
 * checks `title` unconditionally too; the two stay in step.
