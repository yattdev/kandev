/**
 * E2E: a plugin row opens its settings page from a phone.
 *
 * The row used to carry its link on the plugin name alone, styled like the
 * headings around it and underlined only on hover, so a touch device got no
 * affordance at all. The whole card is the target now, with a chevron. This is
 * the phone half of that: `e2e/playwright.config.ts` routes only
 * `mobile-*.spec.ts` at the Pixel 5 project, so the desktop coverage in
 * plugins.spec.ts cannot catch phone wrapping, stacking, or hit-target
 * regressions in the row.
 *
 * One test rather than several: installing the fixture plugin is the expensive
 * part of the setup and every assertion here is about the same rendered row.
