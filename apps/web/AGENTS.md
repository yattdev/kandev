# Frontend (Vite/React SPA) — architecture and conventions

Scoped guidance for `apps/web/`. Repo-wide rules (commit format, code-quality limits, etc.) live in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## UI Components

**Shadcn Components:** Import from `@kandev/ui` package:

```typescript
import { Badge } from "@kandev/ui/badge";
import { Button } from "@kandev/ui/button";
import { Dialog } from "@kandev/ui/dialog";
// etc...
```

**Do NOT** import from `@/components/ui/*` - always use `@kandev/ui` package.

- Always prefer native shadcn components over custom implementations.
- Check `apps/packages/ui/src/` for available components (pagination, table, dialog, etc.).
- For data tables, use `@kandev/ui/table` with TanStack Table; use shadcn Pagination components.
- Only create custom components when shadcn doesn't provide what's needed.

## Data Flow Pattern (Critical)

```text
Go Boot Payload -> Hydrate Store -> Components Read Store -> Hooks Subscribe
```

**Never fetch data directly in components.**

## Store Structure (Domain Slices)

```text
lib/state/
├── store.ts                        # Root composition
├── default-state.ts                # Default state + initial state merge
├── slices/                         # Domain slices
│   ├── kanban/                    # boards, tasks, columns
│   ├── session/                   # sessions, messages, turns, worktrees
│   ├── session-runtime/           # shell, processes, git, context
│   ├── workspace/                 # workspaces, repos, branches
│   ├── settings/                  # executors, agents, editors, prompts (incl. userSettings)

│   └── ui/                        # preview, connection, active state, sidebar views
├── hydration/                     # SSR merge strategies

hooks/domains/{kanban,session,workspace,settings,comments,github}/  # Domain-organized hooks
lib/api/domains/                    # API clients
├── kanban-api, session-api, workspace-api, settings-api, process-api
├── plan-api, queue-api, workflow-api, stats-api, github-api
├── user-shell-api, debug-api, secrets-api, sprites-api, vscode-api
├── health-api, utility-api
```

**Key State Paths:**

- `messages.bySession[sessionId]`, `shell.outputs[sessionId]`, `gitStatus.bySessionId[sessionId]`
- `tasks.activeTaskId`, `tasks.activeSessionId`, `workspaces.activeId`
- `repositories.byWorkspace`, `repositoryBranches.byRepository`

**Hydration:** Go injects `window.__KANDEV_BOOT_PAYLOAD__` into the SPA shell before React mounts. `lib/state/hydration/merge-strategies.ts` has `deepMerge()`, `mergeSessionMap()`, `mergeLoadingState()` to avoid overwriting live client state. Pass `activeSessionId` to protect active sessions.

For rebasing or finishing PRs written against the old Next.js runtime, follow
[`docs/nextjs-spa-migration.md`](../../docs/nextjs-spa-migration.md).

**Hooks Pattern:** Hooks in `hooks/domains/` encapsulate WS subscription + store selection. WS client deduplicates subscriptions automatically.

## WebSockets

**Format:** `{id, type, action, payload, timestamp}`.

Use subscription hooks only; the WS client auto-deduplicates.

When changing task lifecycle WS handlers (`task.updated`, `task.deleted`,
`task.state_changed`), check both kanban and Office surfaces. Archive/delete
events may need to update kanban caches, `tasks.activeTaskId` / session pin
state, recent/sidebar prefs, Office refetch triggers such as
`setOfficeRefetchTrigger("tasks")`, and route redirects for `/t/:id`,
`/tasks/:id`, and `/office/tasks/:id`. Add focused tests for every affected
surface.

## Component conventions

- **Framework adapters during Next removal:** Client components should import
  links, router hooks, dynamic imports, images, and theme hooks from the local
  adapter modules (`components/routing/*`, `lib/routing/*`,
  `components/theme/app-theme`) instead of importing `next/*` or
  `next-themes` directly. The routing/image/dynamic adapters now provide
  browser-native behavior for the Vite SPA while legacy Next entrypoints are
  phased out.
- Components: <200 lines, extract to domain components, composition over props.
- Hooks: domain-organized in `hooks/domains/`, encapsulate subscription + selection.
- **Interactivity:** all buttons and links with actions must have `cursor-pointer` class.
- **Dialog Enter-to-confirm:** the base `@kandev/ui` `DialogContent` / `AlertDialogContent`
  activate the dialog's semantic action on plain Enter (`packages/ui/src/lib/dialog-default-action.ts`),
  so per-dialog "submit on Enter" input handlers are unnecessary — let the base own it.
  Resolution: `AlertDialogAction` → an explicit `data-dialog-default-action` button → the single
  primary (`type="submit"` or `data-variant="default"|"destructive"`) button in `DialogFooter`.
  More than one primary candidate (counting disabled ones), a disabled resolved action, or one inside
  a `hidden`/`aria-hidden` subtree → no-op (never guesses). Left alone: `textarea`/contenteditable,
  Shift/Cmd/Ctrl/Alt+Enter, `event.repeat` auto-repeat, mid-IME composition (`isComposing` or keyCode
  229), already-`preventDefault`ed events, and Enter fired from a focused interactive control that owns
  Enter (any action button — including outline/secondary like Copy/Back — `<select>`, combobox, or a
  listbox option / menu item). Only a slot-marked `alert-dialog-cancel` / `dialog-close` is treated as
  a dismiss control and overridden (the Radix-focuses-Cancel case). A plain single-line `<input>` is
  _not_ exempt — type-to-confirm dialogs rely on Enter firing the primary.
  Pass `enterConfirms={false}` to opt a dialog out; mark the intended button with
  `data-dialog-default-action` when a footer has several action buttons.
- **Radix tooltip on disabled buttons:** disabled buttons do not receive pointer/focus events, so wrap the disabled `Button` in a focusable span and put `TooltipTrigger asChild` on that span:
  ```tsx
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger asChild>
      <span tabIndex={disabled ? 0 : -1} className="inline-flex">
        <Button disabled={disabled}>Run</Button>
      </span>
    </TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent>{disabledReason}</TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
  ```
  Keep the wrapper focusable only while disabled; when enabled, the button itself owns focus.
- **Renaming a `data-testid`:** set the new id as `data-testid="<new>"` and keep
  the old id as `data-legacy-testid="<old>"`, then migrate e2e specs to the new
  id in the same PR. JSX rejects two `data-testid` attributes on one element,
  and Playwright's `getByTestId` only matches one attribute name — the
  `data-legacy-testid` alias lets existing specs keep selecting the element
  while the migration is in flight.
- **Dockview session panel activation:** session chat panels can become active
  through tab pointer/keyboard events, global tab-cycling shortcuts,
  reopen/menu actions, and Dockview close controls. When changing
  `tasks.activeSessionId` or active-session sync, audit all of those paths. Use
  store state in addition to Dockview `api.isActive`; the current session's chat
  tab may be Dockview-inactive while Files/Changes is active. Same-session
  clicks must not leave stale activation intent, and Dockview
  `.dv-default-tab-action` close controls should be treated as close/delete
  actions rather than session-switch intent.
- **GitHub PR status UI:** visual PR/CI status surfaces should use the shared
  helpers in `apps/web/components/github/pr-task-icon.tsx`
  (`hasPRChecksPassedForDisplay`, `hasPRChecksInProgressForDisplay`, and
  `hasPRChecksPassedWithoutReviewWaitForDisplay`) instead of re-deriving status
  from `checks_state`, `checks_total`, or `checks_passing` locally. Aggregate
  check counts are a display-only fallback when `checks_state` is empty; they may
  make chips or task icons render passed/in-progress, but must not enable merge
  actions. Merge readiness must use `isPRReadyToMerge`, which requires GitHub's
  explicit `checks_state === "success"` rollup. When changing PR status behavior,
  update both `pr-task-icon.test.ts` and `pr-status-chip.test.tsx`.
- **Task repository labels:** user-facing task/card repo chips should display a
  stable repo slug or name (`owner/repo` when known, otherwise the repo name),
  not a local filesystem path. Local clone paths or folder paths belong in
  hover/title/tooltip metadata. Tasks with no repository, or only a non-repo
  local folder, should not render a repo chip.

## Code-quality limits

Enforced by `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs` (warnings, will become errors):

- Files: ≤600 lines · Functions: ≤100 lines
- Cyclomatic complexity: ≤15 · Cognitive complexity: ≤20
- Nesting depth: ≤4 · Parameters: ≤5
- No duplicated strings (≥4 occurrences) · No identical functions · No unused imports
- No nested ternaries

When you hit a limit, extract a helper function, custom hook, or sub-component. Prefer composition over growing a single function.

## Testing notes

- jsdom drops `secure` cookies over `http`, so `document.cookie` reads back empty. To assert a cookie write in a Vitest unit test, intercept the setter with `Object.defineProperty(document, "cookie", { set: ... })` and restore it after.
- In Playwright tests, avoid strict locators that assume only one `terminal-panel` or `.xterm` exists. Mobile and dockview layouts can mount multiple terminal instances; scope to the active panel or use `.first()` / `.last()` deliberately with a comment or helper.
- Shared E2E helpers that inspect mounted React/DOM internals must be scoped to the active panel/container, not global selectors, because hidden or stale mounted panels can coexist in dock/mobile layouts.
