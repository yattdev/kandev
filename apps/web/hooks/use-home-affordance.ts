 * - `always` while the sidebar's settings takeover is active (expanded sidebar
 *   in settings mode): the sidebar's Home row is replaced by the settings tree,
 *   so desktop users would otherwise be left with only the unlabelled logo.
 * - `phone` otherwise — below `md` the sidebar is hidden entirely.
 *
 * The href comes from the navigation manifest's home entry, so it follows the
 * active workspace and lands on the office dashboard inside Office.
