/**
 * Regression: the generic "chat" placeholder dockview panel used to fall back
 * to the literal "Agent" label even when the active session's agent profile
 * was loaded (e.g. "Opus"). The bug was a stale `isSessionTab && agentLabel`
 * gate inside `useChatSessionTitle` that suppressed the agent label for the
 * non-session-scoped placeholder. The pure resolver imported here is the place
 * the gate would have to be re-introduced, so this test pins the behavior.
