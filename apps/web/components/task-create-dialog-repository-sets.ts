/**
 * Applying a repository set fills the picker with one row per member. The rules
 * exist so the action is safe to repeat and never loses the user's work:
 *
 *   - additive and idempotent: a repository already in the form is skipped, so
 *     applying the same set twice changes nothing and two overlapping sets give
 *     the union;
 *   - a single blank placeholder row is consumed rather than left behind;
 *   - a row the user configured is never discarded or reordered;
 *   - a member that no longer resolves to a live workspace repository is skipped
 *     and counted, so the UI can say how many were dropped and why;
 *   - branches are left empty for the dialog's per-row branch defaulting, because
 *     branch choice belongs to the task rather than to the set.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function so those rules are testable without rendering the
 * dialog.
