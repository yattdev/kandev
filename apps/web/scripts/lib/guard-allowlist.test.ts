/**
 * Duplicate detection for `i18nGuardFiles`, and the invariant it protects.
 *
 * The bug this pins down (#2214): the sidebar migration appended two paths that
 * earlier migrations had already listed. A duplicate changes no behaviour — the
 * ESLint config just passes the same pattern twice — so it cleared `pnpm lint`,
 * `i18n:check`, the ratchet, `check-guard-allowlist.mjs` itself and 8,218 unit
 * tests. It was caught by eye. What it costs is the record: the array is read as
 * "which PR migrated what", and a second copy silently books someone else's work
 * as the new PR's coverage.
 *
 * Following the pattern in `git-base.test.ts`, the "fixed" assertions are paired
 * with one showing the pre-existing removal check still cannot see a duplicate —
 * a test that only exercised the new helper would not explain why it has to be a
 * separate check.

/**
 * The born-dead entry (#2247). A glob for the `[id]` automations route was
 * appended by a migration and matched NOTHING: glob brackets are a CHARACTER CLASS, so `[id]`
 * means "one `i` or one `d`" and never the literal directory. The route was
 * allowlisted and unguarded at the same time, and every check reported green —
 * it never left the array so the removal check ignored it, it was not repeated
 * so `duplicateEntries` ignored it, and `pnpm lint` passed because the rule had
 * no files to apply. Confirmed then by putting a hardcoded literal in that
 * route: 0 lint errors before escaping, 1 after.
 *
 * These run the REAL `fs.globSync` against a fixture tree rather than a
 * re-implementation of glob semantics — the bracket behaviour is the whole point,
 * so emulating it would only test the emulation. **Do not simplify this back to a
 * hand-rolled matcher.** The first draft did exactly that, and a malformed
 * character class in it (`/[*?[]]{}]/` — a lost backslash) made EVERY entry look
 * unmatched, so the live-allowlist test below reported a problem that did not
 * exist. A false positive that reads as a find is the failure mode this whole
 * area keeps producing; a fixture plus the real matcher cannot have it.
 *
 * As with `duplicateEntries` above, the helper is paired with a test showing both
 * existing checks are blind to it, so the reason it must be separate stays on the
 * record rather than becoming folklore.
