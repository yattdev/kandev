// go/path-injection finding on /api/v1/workspace/rescan: it maps the
// HTTP-supplied work_dir to a path DERIVED from the manager's existing
// cfg.WorkDir, so the value that reaches os.Stat is never the raw HTTP
// input. Only two transitions are allowed: no-op (equal to current) and
// promotion-up-one-level (equal to parent of current).
//
// Inputs are constructed via filepath.Join so the same table covers
// Windows (`C:\...`) and POSIX (`/...`) without per-OS branches in
// every case.
