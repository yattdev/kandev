// TestCheckGitChanges_DetectsPushWithNoOtherChange pins the structural fix
// for a production bug: pollGitChanges' checkGitChanges only re-published
// git status on a HEAD, branch, or working-tree-index change. A push moves
// none of those three — the upstream ref is the only thing that changes —
// so a push-only event was previously invisible to change detection and
// tryUpdateGitStatus never re-fired, meaning the refreshed status carrying
// the new RemoteAhead/RemoteBranch values (which push-detection in
// event_handlers_git.go depends on) was never published at all. This test
// primes the tracker's cache to a pre-push state, pushes for real, and
// asserts a single checkGitChanges call republishes status with the
// post-push RemoteAhead/RemoteBranch, on a HEAD that never moves after the
// prime (matching an already-committed, not-yet-pushed branch).
