## Tooling

- **Package manager**: `pnpm` workspace (run from `apps/`, not repo root)
- **Backend**: Go with Make (`make -C apps/backend test|lint|build`)
- **Frontend**: Vite/React SPA (`cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web dev|build:vite|lint`; for direct web typecheck use `cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck`)
- **Desktop**: Tauri shell (`cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/desktop build|e2e`; Rust tests from `apps/desktop/src-tauri`)
- **UI**: Shadcn components via `@kandev/ui`
- **E2E**: Playwright (`cd apps/web && pnpm e2e:raw`). The `containers` project (gated on `KANDEV_E2E_CONTAINERS=1`, formerly `docker`) covers both the Docker executor and the SSH executor — anything that needs a real Docker daemon on the host lives there. See `apps/web/e2e/README.md`.
- **GitHub repo**: `https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev`
- **Container image**: `ghcr.io/kdlbs/kandev` (GitHub Container Registry)

### Worktrees and commit hooks

A fresh git worktree shares `.git/` but **not** `apps/node_modules/`. The missing install breaks not just the commit-msg hook (`pnpm exec commitlint` → `Command "commitlint" not found` / `ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL`) but any pnpm command — `vitest` fails with `Failed to resolve import "vitest"`, eslint similarly. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` from `apps/` once after creating the worktree, before running tests/lint/commits; subsequent pnpm commands work normally.

## Scoped guidance

Architecture notes and per-area conventions live alongside the code they describe. Read the file in the directory you're working in:

- `apps/backend/AGENTS.md` — Go backend: package structure (incl. `internal/office/` and `internal/agent/runtime/`), key concepts (orchestrator, workflow engine, agent runtime, lifecycle manager), execution flow, provider pattern, backups, testing conventions, Go lint limits.
- `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/AGENTS.md` — agentctl HTTP server: route groups, adapter model, ACP protocol.
- `apps/backend/internal/agentctl/server/api/AGENTS.md` — reverse-proxy body rewriting (`Accept-Encoding`), iframe-blocking header stripping.
- `apps/backend/internal/integrations/AGENTS.md` — adding a new third-party integration (Jira/Linear pattern, both backend and frontend halves). The `/add-integration` skill mirrors this for scaffolding new integrations.
- `apps/desktop/AGENTS.md` — Tauri desktop app: runtime resources, Rust process lifecycle, packaging, signing, and smoke tests.
- `apps/web/AGENTS.md` — Vite/React SPA frontend: shadcn imports, Go boot-payload hydration, store slice structure (incl. `office`), WS format, component conventions, TS lint limits.

## Best Practices

### Engineering Principles

- Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, configuration, and indirection.
- Grow the system in layers. Start from the smallest version that works end to end, and add each new capability on top of a product that already works. Never trade a working product for unfinished complexity.
- Keep components modular and concerns clearly separated.
- Prefer established, well-maintained libraries when they reduce overall complexity or improve reliability. Do not reimplement common functionality without a clear reason.
- Lean on the dependencies already in the project before writing your own implementation or adding packages. Do not assume a library lacks a capability without checking its documentation and types.
- Make architectural decisions for the long term. Do not accept a stopgap that only works for now and is meant to be replaced later.

### Commit Conventions (enforced by CI)

Commits to `main` **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`type: description`). PRs are squash-merged - the PR title becomes the commit, validated by CI. Changelog is auto-generated from these via git-cliff (`cliff.toml`). See `.agents/skills/commit/SKILL.md` for allowed types and examples.

The commitlint hook caps the header at **100 characters** (`type(scope): description`). The pre-commit prettier hook also reformats staged TS/TSX files - if it does, the commit fails. Re-stage the reformatted files and create a new commit (don't `--amend`).

### Release & Versioning

Stable Kandev releases use one **SemVer** `X.Y.Z` across npm, Homebrew, GitHub Releases, Desktop, and containers. Scheduled npm-only Nightlies use `X.Y.(Z+1)-nightly.sha<12-hex>` without moving any Stable channel. Both flows run in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Full details are in the `/release` skill — load it when cutting a release, changing version channels, or debugging release artifacts.

### Code Quality

Static analysis runs in CI and pre-commit. Each subtree has its own thresholds:

- Go limits: see `apps/backend/AGENTS.md` (and `apps/backend/.golangci.yml`).
- TypeScript limits: see `apps/web/AGENTS.md` (and `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs`).

When you hit a limit: extract a helper function, custom hook, or sub-component. Prefer composition over growing a single function.

### Testing

Every code change must include tests for new or changed logic. Backend: `*_test.go` files alongside the source. Frontend: `*.test.ts` files for utility functions, hooks, API clients, and store slices. Exceptions: config files, generated code, React component markup. Use `/tdd` for test-driven development.

### Internationalization

The web UI is localized with i18next (`namespace:key`). **All new user-facing copy
must go through `t()` / `<Trans>`** — never a hardcoded literal — regardless of
which directory you are in.

This is enforced, not just requested. Two ratchets, both of which only tighten:

- **New code, everywhere** — `pnpm run i18n:ratchet` (pre-commit + CI) fails on a
  hardcoded string in a file you added, or on a line you changed, regardless of
  directory. Untouched lines are never judged, so you are never asked to migrate
  code you did not write.
- **Listed paths, whole file** — `i18next/no-literal-string` is a lint error for
  the paths in `i18nGuardFiles` (`apps/web/eslint.i18n.options.mjs`). The
  migration of existing strings is **complete**, and the list covers every area it
  touched; append a path in the same PR that adds it or externalizes one still
  off the list. Never remove an entry to make a build pass — a check rejects that.

Three rules that cause silent, hard-to-find bugs when broken: never translate a
string compared with `===` (type-to-confirm tokens become impossible to type);
never call `t()` at module scope (it freezes at the boot locale and the
pseudo-locale cannot detect it); never pass an English plural ending as a value —
use `count` with `_one`/`_other`. `pnpm run i18n:check` enforces the last two.

A clean lint is not proof a file is done. The rule only sees literals in JSX, and
it **skips anything assigned to a SCREAMING_CASE identifier** — so a
`const ROWS = [{ label: "Disk usage" }]` config table passes silently. Review
those by eye. The pseudo-locale (Settings → General → Appearance, dev/e2e builds)
is the completeness check. Full guide: [`docs/i18n.md`](docs/i18n.md).

### Knowledge
- **Public docs:** Website-ready user documentation lives in `docs/public/**`. Use `/docs-maintainer` when a change affects CLI commands, config keys, install/deploy flows, workflows, executors, public APIs, screenshots, or user-facing terminology.
- **Specs:** Feature specs live in `docs/specs/<slug>/spec.md` — the durable "what & why" of a feature, written before coding. Use `/spec` to write or update a spec. See `docs/specs/INDEX.md`.
- **Decisions:** Architecture decisions are recorded in `docs/decisions/`. Read `docs/decisions/INDEX.md` for an overview. When making significant architectural choices, create a new ADR via `/record decision`.
- **Plans:** Implementation plans are generated from specs via `/plan` and committed under `docs/plans/<slug>/plan.md`, with individual sibling task files named `docs/plans/<slug>/task-<NN>-<short-slug>.md`. Specs are the living requirements; plans and task files are implementation records for the current buildout.

### Plan Implementation
- Specs, plans, and task files are the durable source of implementation scope,
  dependency order, and task-level validation. Keep their statuses and recorded
  command results accurate. The feature and fix skills define the workflow.

### Observability
- In dev mode (`KANDEV_MOCK_AGENT=true` or `debug.pprofEnabled`), `/debug/vars` exposes the stdlib expvar handler. Office provider-routing metrics live under `routing_*` (route attempts, fallbacks, parked runs, provider degraded/recovered counters). The metrics are also still emitted as structured `routing.metric.*` zap logs for human debugging.

### GitHub Operations
Skills use `gh` CLI by default. If a `gh` command fails (not installed, not authenticated, etc.), use whatever GitHub tools are available in the environment (MCP GitHub tools, API tools, etc.) to accomplish the same operation. The goal is the same — the tool may differ.

For multiline Markdown issue or PR bodies, write the body to a file and pass it
with the relevant `gh ... --body-file <path>` option. Do not send escaped
newlines through `--body`; GitHub will render them literally.

For PR review/fixup workflows, prefer the repo helpers before manually querying GitHub/GraphQL: `scripts/pr-state --summary <PR>` for checks and unresolved-thread state, `scripts/pr-state --comment <comment_id>` for a full review-comment body, `scripts/pr-resolve list <PR>` for actionable unresolved review threads, and `scripts/pr-resolve reply <PR> <comment_id> <thread_id> "<body>"` to reply, resolve, and react in one call.

When a Kandev system message references an MCP tool that is not visible in the active tool list, use the runtime's tool discovery mechanism, such as `tool_search` when available, before falling back to a less specific workflow. Some task messaging and platform helpers are exposed on demand.

### Single-Session Model Workflow

The user-started primary session owns durable artifacts, integration judgment,
and user communication. Platform-provided investigation and explorer agents
remain available. Launch planned native implementation subagents only after the
user explicitly authorizes them; this repository does not prescribe their roles
or model tiers.
The read-only `pr-poller` is the sole repository-defined exception: use it only
after the user explicitly asks to wait for or monitor PR updates.

Use the user's strong model for specs, plans, task files, and high-risk design.
When the user asks to proceed with feature planning, produce the spec, plan,
and task files as one design package; pause after a spec only when the user
explicitly requests spec review or a material open question prevents planning.
At the completed-plan checkpoint, return control with a concise handoff. Do not
call `ask_user_question_kandev` (or an equivalent approval prompt) to ask the
user to approve the package or switch models. The user reviews the files,
switches the main session if desired, and sends a later explicit implementation
request. Detailed feature, fix, validation, and delegation routing lives in the
relevant skills, especially `planner-orchestration`.

Workflow-generated phase text such as `[IMPROVE PHASE]`, "implement the
requested change", TDD checklists, verification commands, or commit steps does
not opt a feature or behavior-changing fix out of spec-driven development. If
the request neither references an existing reviewed package nor explicitly asks
to implement a package created during a prior design turn, run
`spec-driven-development` through the plan/task checkpoint and stop before
production or permanent test changes. End that turn at the design-package
handoff; do not ask for approval or a model switch. A generic implementation
envelope is not an explicit opt-out; the user must either explicitly ask to
implement the created package in a later turn or explicitly say to skip
planning.

### Kandev Task Creation

Use Kandev task/session MCP APIs only when the user explicitly asks to create or
manage persistent Kandev platform tasks or sessions. Never use
`create_task_kandev`, `spawn_session_kandev`, or `message_task_kandev` as a
repository-work mechanism or fallback.

When the user explicitly requests related Kandev follow-up work, use
`create_task_kandev` with `parent_id: "self"`. That preserves workspace,
workflow, repository, agent profile, and executor context from the current
task. For genuinely unrelated top-level tasks, do not rely on workspace
defaults when the user expects continuity; explicitly preserve the current
task's `agent_profile_id` / `executor_profile_id`, or ask if the intended
profile is ambiguous.

When the user requests a persistent remediation task discovered during PR
review that must start after merge, create it with `parent_id: "self"`,
`workspace_mode: "new_workspace"`, and the reviewed PR's base branch; otherwise
a same-repository subtask inherits the reviewed branch. Set `start_agent: false`
when the follow-up is intentionally queued until merge.

### Third-party integrations

Jira and Linear are the model (per-workspace credentials, 90s auth-health poller via `internal/integrations/healthpoll`, settings page with status banner). New integrations should **reuse the shared shapes** rather than copying either. Full layout, file conventions, and Jira-vs-Linear divergence notes in `apps/backend/internal/integrations/AGENTS.md` and the `/add-integration` skill — load either when scaffolding a new integration.

### Kandev plugins

Production Kandev plugins live in dedicated repositories, not in this monorepo. Start at the [canonical plugin authoring guide](docs/public/plugins-authoring.md), then use `/create-kandev-plugin` for plugin creation, modification, bug fixes, packaging, release, and marketplace work. Official plugins use public `kdlbs/kandev-plugin-<slug>` repositories and start from [`kdlbs/kandev-plugin-template`](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev-plugin-template). The recommended workflow is: choose recipe → edit manifest → implement → validate → package → smoke test. When the user explicitly requests a persistent Kandev task, attach the plugin repository through that task's workflow; otherwise do not use Kandev task/session APIs as repository-work mechanisms.

Contract authority is intentionally split by implementation boundary: frontend authors use [`docs/plans/plugins/PLUGIN-API.md`](docs/plans/plugins/PLUGIN-API.md) plus [`apps/web/lib/plugins/types.ts`](apps/web/lib/plugins/types.ts), with concrete Host UI exports in `apps/web/lib/plugins/host-api.ts`; backend authors use `apps/backend/pkg/pluginsdk`, the wire contract in `apps/backend/proto/kandev/plugin/v1/plugin.proto`, and manifest/package rules in `apps/backend/internal/plugins/manifest` and `apps/backend/internal/plugins/pkgtar`. The in-tree fixture under `apps/backend/cmd/plugin-fixture` is test support, not a production plugin starter.

### Runtime profiles (prod / dev / e2e)

**`profiles.yaml` at the repo root** is the single source of truth for env-driven runtime defaults — feature flags, mock providers (agent / GitHub / Jira / Linear), debug switches, and e2e tuning knobs. The backend embeds it (`//go:embed` via `apps/backend/internal/profiles/`) and at startup calls `profiles.ApplyProfile()` to write the matching profile's env vars onto its own process, *only when each var is not already set* — so launchers, shells, and per-spec overrides still win.

Runtime feature toggles add a SQLite-backed override tier managed through `Settings > System > Feature Toggles`. Effective values use this precedence: explicit environment variable > SQLite override > profile default. The typed runtime flag registry lives in `apps/backend/internal/runtimeflags/registry.go`; each registration owns the public metadata, environment variable, config reader, and config applier. Do not add parallel per-flag maps or switches.

Profile selection: `KANDEV_E2E_MOCK=true` → `e2e`, `KANDEV_DEBUG_DEV_MODE=true` or `KANDEV_DEBUG_PPROF_ENABLED=true` → `dev`, otherwise `prod`. `apps/cli/src/dev.ts` and `apps/web/e2e/fixtures/backend.ts` set only the selector — they no longer hardcode the underlying values.

For any task that adds, rolls out, promotes, graduates, or removes a release toggle, use `/runtime-feature-flags`. That skill contains the file-by-file checklist, disabled-path requirements, test commands, promotion procedure, and retired-identity removal steps; do not rely on an agent discovering an ADR or public docs. In brief: merge risky features off in every shipped profile, enable a selected install with an admin override or explicit environment, restart and test, then change `prod:` to `"true"` for the all-user release while retaining the registry entry as a kill-switch. Remove the live flag after the feature is permanent, move its key and environment variable to the append-only retired identities in `runtimeflags/registry.go`, and never reuse either identity. Completeness tests cover the registry/profile/frontend contracts. Runtime overrides and restart support are documented in `docs/decisions/0018-runtime-settings-overrides.md` and `docs/decisions/0019-restart-supervisor.md`.
