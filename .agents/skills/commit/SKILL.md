# Commit

## Planner Entry

Stage and commit changes in the primary conversation after the task-defined
implementation checks pass. Do not add broad post-commit `/verify` before push
by default. Preserve the hook receipt as normal commit evidence.

Create a git commit following this project's Conventional Commits convention. These messages are used by git-cliff (`cliff.toml`) to auto-generate changelogs and release notes. PRs are squash-merged, so the PR title becomes the commit on `main` — CI validates it via `pr-title.yml`.

## Available skills

- **`/pr-fixup`** — Use after the PR opens only for CI or actionable reviewer
  findings.

## Format

```
type: lowercase description
```

## Allowed Types

| Type | Use for | In changelog? |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `feat` | New features | Yes (Features) |
| `fix` | Bug fixes | Yes (Bug Fixes) |
| `perf` | Performance improvements | Yes (Performance) |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | Yes (Refactoring) |
| `docs` | Documentation changes | Yes (Documentation) |
| `chore` | Maintenance, deps, configs | No |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | No |
| `test` | Test-only changes | No |

## Rules

- Subject **must** start with a lowercase letter
- Scope is optional: `feat(ui): add dialog` is valid
- Include PR/issue number when relevant: `feat: add release notes (#295)`
- Breaking changes: add `!` after type: `feat!: remove legacy API`
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Body lines must be ≤100 characters** (commitlint `body-max-line-length`). Hard-wrap bullet points before committing; long URLs or prose lines that exceed 100 chars will fail the hook with `body's lines must not be longer than 100 characters`. If a HEREDOC body fails, re-wrap and create a *new* commit — do not amend.

## Examples

```
feat: add release notes dialog
fix: flaky test in orchestrator (#292)
refactor: extract session handler into separate module
chore: update dependencies
ci: add PR title linting workflow
```

## Steps

Track these steps with an internal todo/checklist and mark them complete as you go.
Do not create, update, or delete Kandev subtasks for this workflow unless the user
explicitly requests task tracking.

1. **Understand changes:** Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand all changes. Review recent commits with `git log --oneline -10` to match project style.

2. **Ensure pre-commit hooks are wired up.** This must work in worktrees too, where `.git/` is a file (not a directory) and the real hooks path is shared with the main repo via `core.hooksPath`. Use `git rev-parse --git-path` so the check resolves correctly regardless:

   ```bash
   # Is the framework on PATH?
   pre-commit --version >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "INSTALLED" || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"

   # Is the hook actually wired into git's hook system?
   PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_PATH=$(git rev-parse --git-path hooks/pre-commit)
   COMMIT_MSG_HOOK_PATH=$(git rev-parse --git-path hooks/commit-msg)
   test -f "$PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_PATH" && grep -q "pre-commit" "$PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_PATH" \
     && test -f "$COMMIT_MSG_HOOK_PATH" && grep -q "pre-commit" "$COMMIT_MSG_HOOK_PATH" \
     && echo "ACTIVE" || echo "INACTIVE"
   ```

   - If **NOT_INSTALLED**, tell the user once: _"⚠️ pre-commit is not on PATH. Install it with `pip install pre-commit` so format/lint runs on every commit."_ Then continue (don't block).
   - If installed but **INACTIVE**, **install it yourself** — the project ships `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `make doctor` is a no-op-on-already-installed wrapper around the same command:
     ```bash
     pre-commit install -t pre-commit -t commit-msg --overwrite
     ```
     Mention that you wired it up. Subsequent commits will run hooks automatically.
   - If both checks pass, no output needed.

   - Before the first commit, ensure the worktree can run the commit-msg
     dependency. If `apps/node_modules/.bin/commitlint` is absent, install it
     from `apps/` before committing:
     ```bash
     cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
     ```
     Retry the normal commit after the install; never bypass the hook.

   - After merging or rebasing the base branch, if `apps/package.json` or
     `apps/pnpm-lock.yaml` changed and a hook reports
     `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` even though `apps/node_modules/.bin/commitlint`
     exists, refresh the workspace dependencies from `apps/`:
     ```bash
     cd apps && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
     ```
     Retry the normal commit without bypassing hooks.

   Why this matters: a missing hook lets lint regressions slip past local commits and only surface in CI (e.g. funlen / cognitive complexity on backend Go code). The hook catches them in <1s at commit time. See `Makefile`'s `doctor` target for the idempotent install command.

3. **Capture the parent SHA and preserve hook evidence:**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```
   Never use `--no-verify`, `SKIP`, or another hook-bypass option or
   environment variable. A bypassed commit is allowed only when the user
   explicitly requests it, and its receipt must say `bypass: true`; it never
qualifies as a successful hook receipt.

4. **Stage files:** Stage relevant files (prefer specific files over `git add -A`).
   Before reviewing or committing, inspect every `??` path from `git status
   --short`; `git diff` omits untracked files. Stage each relevant path or read
   it explicitly so new tests and helpers are not missed.
   - **Splitting commits with new files:** When introducing a brand-new file alongside the file that uses it, stage them together. The Go lint pre-commit hook stashes *unstaged* changes before linting but keeps *untracked* files in the working tree — so a new helper committed alone, while its (still-unstaged) caller sits in the working tree, lints as `unused` and rejects the commit.

5. **Commit:** Write a commit message following the format above. If changes span multiple concerns, consider separate commits.
   When `MERGE_HEAD` exists or a merge commit is being completed, use
   `git commit --no-edit` so a non-interactive runner does not open an editor;
   normal hooks still run. Confirm the merge commit exists and `MERGE_HEAD` is
   gone before reporting success.
   If a formatter changes files and prevents the commit, review and re-stage
   those files, then create a new commit attempt; do not use `--amend`.
   A failed hook can leave all intended changes staged. Keep the staged changes,
   fix the reported lint issue, rerun the affected test, and retry the normal
   commit; do not use `--no-verify` or amend to bypass the failure.
   When editing harness files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or skills, run
   the shared validation in
   `.agents/skills/harness-improvement/references/validation.md` before
   committing.
   If full-repository spec lint fails on a pre-existing duplicate acceptance ID
   while the active hook requires a clean result, confirm it is baseline-only,
   make the smallest unique-ID correction needed for that hook, rerun the full
   lint, and record the baseline correction in the implementation record. Do
   not bypass the hook or leave the repository-wide failure unexplained.
   If a JSX layout-only edit touches an element containing an existing
   hardcoded user-facing literal, `i18n-new-code` may classify that literal as
   changed copy and fail. Localize it and add matching `en`/`pseudo` catalog
   entries before retrying; verify with `cd apps/web && pnpm run i18n:check` and
   the normal hook receipt.
   If the commit command returns an `exec_command` `session_id`, preserve the
   full result and poll that same session until it is terminal; never start a
   second commit attempt while the first is live. Retain the exact temporary
   log path from that single attempt for the hook receipt. Capture the normal
   hook stream in a temporary log while committing and use that log to record
   each hook ID and result. RTK can condense `rtk git commit`
   output, so use `rtk proxy git commit` when preserving raw hook output. Do not
   infer hook results from a condensed launcher summary. For example:
   ```bash
   COMMIT_LOG="$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/kandev-commit.XXXXXX.log")"
   set -o pipefail
   rtk proxy git commit -m "type(scope): description" 2>&1 | rtk proxy tee "$COMMIT_LOG" >/dev/null
   ```
   Both the commit and `tee` stages must use raw-output mode when the log is
   parsed; normal `rtk git commit` output may contain only `ok <sha>` and is not
   hook evidence. Read the log to extract every hook ID/result and confirm the receipt still
   says `bypass: false`, rather than printing the full stream again. Remove the
   exact temporary file after copying the receipt into
   the handoff:
   ```bash
   unlink "$COMMIT_LOG"
   ```
   If a timed-out hook leaves a commit or linter process running, inspect
   `git status`, `git log`, and only that attempt's processes before retrying.
   Wait for or stop the owned process tree first; do not mistake a transient
   `parallel golangci-lint is running` message for a second commit failure.
   If the commit exits nonzero, preserve and print the full or bounded log
   before cleanup so hook diagnostics are not lost. Remove the temporary log
   only after copying a successful hook receipt or recording the failed output.
   When extracting receipt lines from a nested shell, use shell-safe single-
   quoted `awk` or `sed` expressions; a double-quoted `sed` range containing
   `$` can be expanded by the outer shell and hide the receipt. Record active
   hooks that report `Skipped` or `no files to check` as `skipped`; do not infer
   their result from the launcher's summary, and retain the log until both the
   pre-commit and commit-msg results are recorded.

   If a hook fails only because another worktree is already running
   golangci-lint (for example, `parallel golangci-lint is running`), wait for
   that run to finish and retry the same commit. Do not bypass hooks or change
   code for this transient lock; verify the retry has a normal hook receipt and
   a clean worktree.

   If a hook fails with `ENOSPC`, load `/verify`'s Disk-constrained runners
   guidance: inspect `df`, preserve managed caches, relocate only the affected
   cache to an explicit persistent agent-owned path, and never bypass hooks or
   blindly delete shared caches.

6. **Return a hook receipt:** After a successful commit, report:
   ```text
   parent_sha: <pre-commit HEAD>
   commit_sha: <new HEAD>
   pre_commit_hook: active|inactive
   commit_msg_hook: active|inactive
   hook_results: <hook-id=passed|skipped, ...>
   bypass: false|true
   commit_result: pass
   worktree: clean|dirty
   ```
   `verify` may use the receipt only when both hooks are active, bypass is
   false, the commit succeeded, the current `HEAD` still equals `commit_sha`,
   and the worktree is clean. The commit worker does not run verification.
