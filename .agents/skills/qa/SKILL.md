# QA

## Planner Entry

The user-started primary session delegates this
entire procedure to the registered `qa` worker, reviews its report, and creates
new implementer assignments for any fixes. It does not run QA or fix findings
directly. An explicitly assigned `qa` worker continues below and does not spawn
other workers.

Verify that a feature works as intended after implementation. Assume bugs exist and hunt for them.

Mindset: you are not confirming it works — you are discovering where it breaks.

## Available skills

- **`/tdd`** — Recommend for an implementer assignment when unit or integration coverage is missing.
- **`/e2e`** — Recommend for an implementer assignment when a user-facing flow lacks browser coverage.

## Before starting: create the pipeline

Create these tasks immediately (use your task/todo tracking tool if available):

1. **Understand the intent** — Read task/PR/commits to understand what was built
2. **Trace the wiring** — Verify the feature is actually connected end-to-end
3. **Test the happy path** — Run the feature as a user would
4. **Try to break it** — Boundary values, error paths, concurrency, auth
5. **Verify test coverage** — Check for missing tests and report gaps
6. **Report** — Summarize findings with verdict

Mark each task in_progress when you begin it and completed when you finish it.

## Phase 1: Understand the intent

Mark task 1 as in_progress.

Read the task description, PR, or recent commits to understand what was built and what it should do. Identify:
- The expected behavior (happy path)
- System boundaries (user input, API endpoints, external data)
- Integration points (what calls what, data flow end-to-end)

Mark task 1 as completed.

## Phase 2: Trace the wiring

Mark task 2 as in_progress.

Before testing behavior, verify the feature is actually connected:
- Exports are imported and used (not just defined)
- API routes have consumers (frontend calls them, or tests exercise them)
- Data flows end-to-end: input -> handler -> storage -> response -> display
- New config/env vars are documented and have defaults

If something is orphaned or unwired, stop and report it — no point testing disconnected code.

Mark task 2 as completed.

---

## Phase 3: Test the happy path

Mark task 3 as in_progress.

Run the feature as a user would. For backend changes, call the API. For frontend changes, trace the UI flow. For both, follow the full path:
- Does the basic use case work?
- Does the response/output match expectations?
- Is the data persisted correctly?

Mark task 3 as completed.

---

## Phase 4: Try to break it

Mark task 4 as in_progress.

Systematically test these categories (skip what doesn't apply):

**Boundary values:**
- Empty input, nil/null, zero, negative numbers, max values
- Empty arrays/maps, single element, very large collections
- Strings: empty, whitespace-only, special characters, very long

**Error paths:**
- What happens when dependencies fail (DB down, API timeout, invalid response)?
- Are errors surfaced clearly or silently swallowed?
- Does the system recover or get stuck in a bad state?

**Concurrency:**
- What happens with simultaneous requests to the same resource?
- Race conditions: create/update/delete at the same time
- Does it handle duplicate submissions?

**Authorization:**
- Can the feature be accessed without proper auth?
- Does it respect permission boundaries?

Mark task 4 as completed.

---

## Phase 5: Verify test coverage

Mark task 5 as in_progress.

Check that the implementation has tests covering the behaviors you just verified:
- Are the happy path and key error paths tested?
- Are edge cases from Phase 4 covered?
- Are tests at the right level: unit for pure logic, integration for boundaries, E2E for critical browser flows?
- Do tests assert behavior/state/output rather than implementation details or mock behavior?
- If tests are missing, report the exact behavior and recommended test level so
  the planner can assign a `test-engineer` worker.
- Avoid snapshot tests unless the snapshot change will be deliberately reviewed.

Mark task 5 as completed.

---

## Phase 6: Report

Mark task 6 as in_progress.

Summarize what was tested and what was found:

**Verified working:**
- List of behaviors confirmed working

**Issues found:**
- file:line - description, how to reproduce, severity (blocker/suggestion)

**Missing test coverage:**
- Behaviors that work but have no automated test

**Verdict:** Feature complete / Has issues — fix before merge

Mark task 6 as completed.
