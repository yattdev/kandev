# Simplify

Post-implementation simplification pass. Review recently changed code and actively simplify it while preserving all behavior.

## Planner Entry

The user-started primary session delegates this
procedure to the registered `simplify` worker and assigns verification to the
`verify` worker afterward. It does not edit or verify the code directly. An
explicitly assigned simplify worker continues below and does not spawn workers.

The best code is code you don't have to write. The second best is code anyone can read.

## Available skills and subagents

- **`verify` worker** — The planner runs this after simplification to ensure all
  tests, lints, and typechecks still pass.

## Steps

### 1. Identify what to simplify

Run `git diff --name-only` (or `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --name-only` for a branch) to get the changed files. Read each one.

### 2. Apply simplifications

Work through each changed file. Preserve behavior by inspection; do not run
tests, lint, typecheck, or full verification from the simplify assignment.
Report any verification concerns or focused checks the planner should delegate.

**Inline one-off abstractions:**
- Helper functions with a single call site — inline them
- Wrapper types that add no behavior — remove the wrapper
- Interfaces with a single implementation and no test mock — remove the interface

**Remove speculative code:**
- Unused function parameters or return values
- Config options that are parsed but never read
- "Reserved for future" scaffolding, empty extension points
- Feature flags with no toggle mechanism

**Reduce nesting:**
- Replace nested if/else with early returns (guard clauses)
- Replace nested ternaries with if/else or switch
- Extract deeply nested blocks into named functions

**Replace cleverness with clarity:**
- Dense one-liners that hide intent — expand to readable multi-line
- Overly generic code where a concrete implementation is simpler
- Abstractions that add indirection without reducing duplication

**Remove noise:**
- Comments that restate code (`// increment counter` above `counter++`)
- Redundant type annotations where inference works
- Empty error handlers, unused catch variables
- Leftover debug logging

### 3. Verify

Report the required full verification and any focused concerns to the planner;
do not run verification yourself. The planner delegates it to the `verify`
worker. If anything breaks, the simplification changed behavior and the
planner assigns the correction to a worker.

### 4. Summary

Report what was simplified:
- Files modified
- What was removed/inlined/simplified
- Lines removed (net)
- Verification concerns or recommended focused checks
