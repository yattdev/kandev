# Create Implementation Plan

This is a planner-side artifact skill. The user-started primary planner creates
the plan and worker packets, then delegates every execution task.

Translate a feature spec into a concrete, phased implementation plan saved under
`docs/plans/<feature>/`. Plans and task files are committed implementation
records for the current buildout; specs remain the durable requirements under
`docs/specs/`.

## Input

- The feature spec (`docs/specs/<slug>/spec.md`) — read it first
- The codebase — explore relevant areas before designing

## Output

- `docs/plans/<slug>/plan.md` — a structured plan that links back to the spec
  and references every task file
- `docs/plans/<slug>/task-<NN>-<short-slug>.md` — one independently executable
  implementation task per file

---

## Steps

### 1. Read the spec

Read `docs/specs/<slug>/spec.md` in full. Identify:
- The observable behaviors (What section)
- The scenarios — each is a potential test case
- Any out-of-scope items (don't plan for these)

### 2. Explore the codebase

Search in parallel for all integration points the spec touches:
- Relevant models, repos, services, handlers
- Similar existing features to reuse as patterns
- Frontend state slices, hooks, and components in the area
- Existing tests in the area (to understand the testing patterns)

Use `docs/decisions/INDEX.md` to check for relevant architectural decisions.

Map dependencies before writing tasks. Implementation order follows the dependency chain: persistence/contracts first, service behavior next, API/client wiring after that, then UI and E2E. Prefer vertical slices that leave the product working over broad horizontal layers that cannot be verified until the end.

### 3. Ask before designing (if needed)

If the spec leaves implementation choices open, ask — one question at a time. Do not assume. Examples of things to ask:
- Which table/model owns new data?
- Is a new API endpoint needed or does an existing one extend?
- Should this be behind a feature flag?

Stop asking when you have enough to write the plan.

### 4. Write plan.md

Save to `docs/plans/<slug>/plan.md`. Use this structure:

```markdown
---
spec: docs/specs/<slug>/spec.md
created: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft
---

# Implementation Plan: <Feature Name>

## Overview
2-4 sentences. What changes, in what order, and why that order.

---

## Backend

### <Area 1 — e.g., Schema Changes>
For each change: file path, exact struct/function/SQL, reason.

### <Area 2 — e.g., Service Layer>
...

### <Area N>
...

---

## Frontend

> Skip this section if the spec has no user-facing changes.

### <Component / Page>
File path, what changes, why.

### API client
What new calls are needed and where they go.

### State
Store slice / hook changes.

---

## Tests

Every plan MUST include this section. For each testable behavior in the spec, list:
- **What:** the behavior under test (maps to a spec scenario)
- **File:** where the test goes (`*_test.go` or `*.test.ts`)
- **How:** table-driven unit test / integration test with real DB / mock service

At minimum, include:
- One unit test per new function with non-trivial logic
- One integration test that exercises the full path (handler → service → repo)
- One test per edge case called out in the spec scenarios

---

## E2E Tests

> Skip this section only if the spec has zero user-visible UI changes.

For each user-facing scenario in the spec:
- **Scenario:** restate the GIVEN/WHEN/THEN from the spec
- **File:** `apps/web/e2e/<area>/<name>.spec.ts`
- **What to verify:** the observable outcome (URL change, element visible, toast shown)

---

## Implementation Waves

Group all task files into waves. Parallelism rules:
- Backend packages: can run in parallel
- Frontend (Vite/React SPA): usually sequential because shared build, type, and state surfaces overlap
- E2E: after all backend + frontend changes are done

```
Wave 1 (parallel):
- [ ] [task-01-backend-contracts](task-01-backend-contracts.md)
- [ ] [task-02-backend-repository](task-02-backend-repository.md)

Wave 2:
- [ ] [task-03-frontend-ui](task-03-frontend-ui.md)

Wave 3:
- [ ] [task-04-e2e](task-04-e2e.md)
```

For small features (≤3 tasks total), waves are optional — list sequentially.

The plan links to task files; it does not contain full task bodies. Update the
checkbox/status link when a task is completed.

## Open Questions
(Delete when empty.)

### 5. Write task files

Create one task file beside `plan.md` per task, named
`docs/plans/<slug>/task-<NN>-<short-slug>.md`. Use this structure:

```markdown
---
id: "01-backend-contracts"
title: "Backend contracts"
status: pending
wave: 1
depends_on: []
plan: "plan.md"
spec: "../../specs/<slug>/spec.md"
---

# Task 01: Backend contracts

Each task should be small enough for one focused implementation pass:
- **Acceptance:** 1-3 concrete conditions.
- **Verification:** exact command(s), e.g. `cd apps/backend && go test -run TestName ./internal/path/...` or `cd apps && pnpm --filter @kandev/web test -- path/to/file.test.ts`.
- **Files likely touched:** specific paths, not broad directories.
- **Dependencies:** task numbers that must land first, or `None`.
- **Inputs:** relevant spec sections, plan sections, patterns, and dependencies.
- **Output contract:** summary, files changed, tests run, blockers, risks, and
  task status update.

Break a task down further if it touches unrelated subsystems, needs more than one focused session, or the title contains "and".

When an implementation agent starts the task, it must change `status` to
`in_progress`. When it finishes, it must change `status` to `done` and update
the corresponding checkbox/status in `plan.md`.
```

### Style rules

- **Be specific.** Name exact file paths, function signatures, SQL column names. The implementing agent should not need to re-explore the codebase.
- **No speculation.** Only plan what the spec requires. Do not add "nice to have" items.
- **Tests are not optional.** Every plan must have a Tests section. E2E is required whenever there are UI changes.
- **Frontend is not optional.** If the spec has any user-visible behavior, the plan must have a Frontend section.
- **Keep it proportional.** A small spec gets a 1-page plan. A large spec may need 3-4 pages. Do not pad.
- **Keep task bodies out of the plan.** Put implementation details in individual
  task files and link to them from `plan.md`.
