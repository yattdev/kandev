# Adding a new third-party integration

## Planner Entry

Load `/spec-driven-development`. The user-started
primary session plans the integration and delegates each backend, frontend,
test, and documentation task to bounded workers. It does not scaffold or verify
the integration directly. An explicitly assigned implementer follows the
relevant sections below and does not spawn other workers.

Jira and Linear are the model: per-workspace credentials, a 90s auth-health poller, a settings page with status banner + reconnect CTA, link/import buttons that gate on availability. New integrations should **reuse the shared shapes** rather than copying either.

## Backend (`apps/backend/internal/<name>/`)

- Mirror the package layout: `service.go`, `store.go`, `client.go`, `provider.go`, `handlers.go`, `models.go`, `poller.go`. Expose `Provide(writer, reader *sqlx.DB, secrets SecretStore, eventBus bus.EventBus, log *logger.Logger) (*Service, func() error, error)`. Pass `nil` for `eventBus` when the integration doesn't publish events; both Jira and Linear take and use it for issue-watch publishing.
- Use `internal/integrations/secretadapter` instead of writing your own upsert wrapper around `secrets.SecretStore`. The adapter satisfies any per-integration `SecretStore` interface shaped as `{Reveal, Set, Delete, Exists}`.
- Use `internal/integrations/healthpoll` for the auth-health loop. Implement the `Prober` interface (`ListConfiguredWorkspaces` + `RecordAuthHealth`) on a small adapter and let `healthpoll.New("name", prober, log)` own Start/Stop/ticker. Keep integration-specific loops (JQL polling, webhook reconciliation, etc.) separate, like jira's issue-watch loop.
- Wire the service via a per-domain `init<Name>Service(...)` helper in `cmd/kandev/services.go`, not inline in `provideServices`.
- Ship a `mock_client.go` + `mock_controller.go` next to the real client. `Provide` branches on `KANDEV_MOCK_<NAME>=true` and returns the in-memory client; `RegisterMockRoutes(router, svc, log)` mounts `/api/v1/<name>/mock/*` only when the service was built with the mock. The e2e backend fixture sets the env var so Playwright tests drive the mock via `apiClient.mock<Name>*()` helpers — see jira/linear for the layout.

## Frontend

- Hooks live under `hooks/domains/<name>/`, **not** `components/<name>/`.
- Use `hooks/domains/integrations/use-integration-availability.ts` and `use-integration-enabled.ts` — each integration's `useXAvailable` / `useXEnabled` should be a one-line wrapper passing the storage key + sync event + config-fetch function.
- Settings page reuses `<IntegrationAuthStatusBanner>` (`components/integrations/auth-status-banner.tsx`).
- "Auth required / reconnect" UI reuses `<IntegrationAuthErrorMessage>` (`components/integrations/auth-error-message.tsx`) — supply the integration's display name, regex check, and reconnect href.
- Link / import popovers reuse `<ValidatedPopover>` (`components/integrations/validated-popover.tsx`) — supply the icon, label, key regex, fetch function, and success callback.

## Where Jira and Linear deliberately diverge

- **Issue model:** Jira uses transitions + JQL; Linear uses state IDs + structured filters. Don't merge these schemas — the upstream APIs are genuinely different.
- **Watch filter persistence:** Jira stores the JQL string verbatim; Linear stores the structured `SearchFilter` as JSON in `filter_json` (Linear has no JQL equivalent). The orchestrator emits `NewJiraIssueEvent` / `NewLinearIssueEvent` respectively and dedups by issue key (Jira) vs identifier (Linear).
- **Health column extras:** Linear's `linear_configs` row carries an `org_slug` captured from successful probes; Jira's row does not.
