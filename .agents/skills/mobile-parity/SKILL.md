description: Ensures UI feature work ships with desktop and mobile parity, responsive behavior, and mobile Playwright E2E coverage. Use when implementing, planning, reviewing, or testing any new feature, page, component, workflow, form, dialog, sidebar, navigation, dashboard, or visual UI change; if work touches frontend or user-facing UI, this skill must run even when user mentions only desktop or says "new feature".

# Mobile Parity

Use this skill before changing UI code for a feature. Goal: feature works on desktop and mobile, and tests prove the mobile path.

## When It Applies

Apply when task changes user-facing UI:

- new or changed pages, routes, components, forms, dialogs, drawers, navigation, dashboards, tables, cards, toolbars, editors, settings, onboarding, or visual states
- new frontend behavior attached to backend/API work
- bug fixes where layout, touch behavior, scrolling, or viewport width can affect success

If task has no UI surface, say why this skill does not apply and continue.

## Workflow

1. Map affected surfaces.
   - Identify every page, modal, menu, tab, empty state, loading state, and error state the feature touches.
   - Check where desktop layout assumptions can fail: fixed widths, hover-only controls, sidebars, tables, dense toolbars, keyboard shortcuts, overflow, and absolute positioning.

2. Design desktop and mobile behavior together.
   - Prefer existing responsive patterns in the repo.
   - Define mobile navigation, stacking order, scrolling region, touch targets, and truncated text behavior before coding.
   - Make primary actions reachable without hover and without horizontal page scroll.

3. Implement responsive UI.
   - Use semantic controls and existing design-system components.
   - Keep touch targets large enough for touch use, generally at least 44px in the active dimension.
   - Ensure forms, dialogs, sheets, menus, tables, and empty states fit narrow screens.
   - Avoid hiding required functionality on mobile unless there is a clear alternate path.

4. Add E2E coverage.
   - Add or update Playwright tests for the feature's happy path on desktop if missing.
   - Add mobile Playwright coverage for the same user value, using existing mobile projects/devices when configured.
   - In this repo, name mobile test files `mobile-*.spec.ts` so the `mobile-chrome` Playwright project picks them up automatically.
   - If no mobile project exists, configure the test or project with a realistic mobile viewport plus touch/mobile settings.
   - Cover mobile-specific controls such as drawers, overflow menus, stacked actions, responsive tables, or bottom controls.
   - When a touch-only control is replaced or hidden, run `rg` across mobile E2E tests for the removed control. Replace every affected interaction with the intended gesture or alternate control, then run those tests together.

5. Verify visually and behaviorally.
   - Run the narrowest relevant viewport locally or with screenshots when possible.
   - Even small user-facing UI tweaks need at least focused rendered verification when feasible: dev-server/browser check, Playwright screenshot, or targeted E2E. If not run, report the exact reason.
   - Check that text does not overlap, controls remain clickable, focus/keyboard flows still work, and no unintended horizontal scroll appears.
   - Run the focused Playwright tests. If full E2E cannot run, report the command and blocker.
   - E2E runs against the production Vite build served by the Go backend, not a dev server, so rebuild after frontend changes: `make build-web` (and `make build-backend` for Go), or use `make test-e2e` which rebuilds both. Skipping this silently tests stale code. See `/e2e`.

## Mobile E2E Expectations

Every UI feature should end with one of these:

- mobile Playwright test added or updated
- existing mobile Playwright test explicitly identified as covering the changed behavior
- written justification for no mobile test, limited to impossible-to-test infrastructure gaps

For frontend changes that are purely state/data normalization inside an existing component and do not alter rendered layout, touch behavior, scrolling, navigation, or viewport-dependent interaction, targeted unit/component tests plus an explicit note can satisfy mobile parity. New mobile Playwright coverage is not required for that narrow case.

Good mobile tests assert real user outcomes, not only visibility. Prefer:

- open feature from mobile navigation and complete primary action
- use drawer/menu/sheet variant of desktop controls
- submit form and verify result
- handle empty/error/loading state on narrow viewport
- confirm no required action is desktop-only

## Playwright Pattern

Use repo conventions first. In this repo, create `mobile-*.spec.ts` files and let the `mobile-chrome` project apply the mobile device; do not add per-test device overrides. Follow `/e2e` conventions for fixture imports, page objects, selectors, and local reproduction. Adjust the fixture import path to the spec location: top-level `tests/mobile-*.spec.ts` files use `../fixtures/test-base`, while nested files use paths such as `../../fixtures/test-base`.

```ts
import { test, expect } from "../../fixtures/test-base";

test.describe("feature on mobile", () => {
  test("completes primary workflow", async ({ testPage }) => {
    await testPage.goto("/feature");
    await testPage.getByRole("button", { name: /menu|open/i }).click();
    await testPage.getByRole("link", { name: /feature/i }).click();

    await expect(
      testPage.getByRole("heading", { name: /feature/i }),
    ).toBeVisible();
    await testPage.getByRole("button", { name: /primary action/i }).click();
    await expect(testPage.getByText(/success|saved|created/i)).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

## Done Checklist

- Desktop path still works.
- Mobile path has designed layout and interaction behavior.
- Required controls are reachable by touch.
- No required workflow depends on hover, wide viewport, or hidden desktop-only UI.
- Mobile E2E tests no longer invoke touch controls that the change replaced or hid.
- Mobile Playwright coverage exists or absence is justified.
- Focused rendered/visual verification was run for UI tweaks, or exact "not run" reason is reported.
- Focused tests were run, or exact blocker is reported.
