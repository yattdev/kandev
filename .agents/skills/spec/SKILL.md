description: Create or update Kandev product requirements and system-design documents before implementation. Use for new product behavior, changed contracts, or explicit specification work. Do not use for implementation plans, work orders, incidents, or behavior-preserving refactors.

# Specification Authoring

Use this skill to create or update durable specifications. Requirements define
observable behavior. System designs define the technical path that satisfies
requirements.

The canonical rules are in `docs/specs/guide/`. Read these files before you
write an artifact:

- Always read `structure-and-ownership.md`.
- Read `requirements.md` for requirement work.
- Read `system-design.md` for system-design work.
- Read `traceability-and-lifecycle.md` for IDs, statuses, references, or
  migration work.

Use the templates in `docs/specs/templates/`.

## Artifact routing

Route the request before you write:

| Request | Artifact |
| --- | --- |
| Kandev-wide purpose, actors, principles, measures, or constraints | `docs/specs/product/` |
| Observable behavior for one owning system | `<system>/requirements/` |
| Technical contracts, models, boundaries, or control flow | `<system>/system-design/` |
| Durable choice with meaningful alternatives | `/record` and an ADR |
| Delivery sequence and implementation tasks | `/plan` |
| Incident or behavior-preserving refactor | No product requirement |
| Bug | `/fix`, which checks the existing requirement first |

Do not create a generic `spec.md` file.

When routing to `docs/specs/product/`, read `docs/specs/product/README.md`
before editing. Treat its **Product document index** as the local index: read
every linked product document and any co-located `INDEX.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, or other instruction file when present. Product files provide
cross-system context, not feature requirements; preserve proposed and
open-question language instead of promoting it to an active contract without
confirmation.

## Workflow

### 1. Locate the owning system

Read `docs/specs/README.md` and the likely system `README.md`. If the system
has not migrated, run this command to locate the legacy source:

    python3 scripts/list-docs.py specs --kind legacy --format paths

Search the catalog, requirements, and designs for the capability name and its
main nouns:

    python3 scripts/list-docs.py specs --text <capability-term> --format paths

Update an existing capability when it owns the same actor, lifecycle, and
contract.

Choose the system that owns the source of truth and durable contract. Do not
choose an owner from the code directories that change. Record one sentence in
the working notes that states why the selected system owns the capability.

User visibility does not make a capability UI-owned. Keep provider state, task
state, permissions, persistence, and recovery with their owning systems. Put
desktop, mobile, accessibility, and visible failure outcomes in that owner's
requirement. Create a UI requirement only for an independent and reusable
presentation contract.

The same system owns the requirement and its design. Other systems link to that
source. They do not copy it or claim its requirement IDs in design frontmatter.

If no system owns the behavior, define the new system boundary before you write
requirements. A new system needs a `README.md` based on the system template.

### 2. Confirm intent

Run the `/interview-me` assumption check, reusing answers from earlier phases.
Resolve material choices before writing the affected contract. Preserve settled
terminology and decision rationale in the owning artifacts through that skill.
Do not hide an unresolved choice in a draft.

### 3. Write requirements

Create or update:

```text
docs/specs/<system>/requirements/<capability>.md
```

Each requirement document must contain:

- Valid frontmatter.
- One or more stable `REQ-*` IDs.
- At least one `AC-*` acceptance criterion for each requirement.
- Observable behavior and explicit exclusions.

Use user stories only when they clarify a natural actor and outcome. Do not put
files, functions, database queries, or implementation sequences in a
requirement.

Keep one cohesive vertical outcome together. Do not create separate backend and
UI requirements for the same feature. Split only when actors, lifecycles, or
contracts are independent.

### 4. Write system design

Create or update this file when the change needs a technical design:

```text
docs/specs/<system>/system-design/<capability>.md
```

The design must list the applicable `REQ-*` IDs in frontmatter. It can use an
explicit empty list for internal infrastructure with no independent product
requirement.

Describe stable components, models, contracts, flow, failure behavior,
persistence, security, and observability when they apply. Link to global ADRs.
Do not copy requirement or ADR text.

Cover all runtime boundaries that implement the owned outcome. A provider-owned
design can include backend services, storage, projections, frontend components,
responsive behavior, and tests. Do not create a parallel UI design for those
same requirements.

### 5. Update the system boundary

Update the system `README.md` only when the system boundary, migration record,
or related-system links change. State the system boundary and link adjacent
systems when ownership can be confused. Do not add a requirement or
system-design list.

Before and after adding required links, run `wc -c <system>/README.md`. Near
the 12 KiB `system-index` limit, keep every required link but use concise
labels or other non-semantic compression; never add a size exception. Rerun
the specification linter after the index update. Also search the README for
count or list summaries, update them when the authoritative pair count changes,
and verify that each stated count matches the indexed requirement/design pairs.

During migration, name the new source as authoritative. Replace the old source
with a link or archive it. Do not leave two editable sources of truth.

If a migration branch merges or rebases a moving base, re-inventory the
migration root after the update. Review files newly added by the base, migrate
them or explicitly record them as unmigrated additions before marking the
migration complete, then rerun the full specification lint.

### 6. Validate

Review the artifacts before you run the linter:

- One system owns each requirement and its design.
- No adjacent system contains a copied requirement or UI-only duplicate.
- Requirements contain observable behavior, not storage, control flow, or file
  details.
- Every acceptance criterion states a testable behavior. No criterion delegates
  its meaning to migrated source detail.
- Selection, restoration, and recovery criteria state candidate eligibility,
  invalid or ambiguous fallback behavior, and forbidden side effects.
- Designs map requirement IDs without copying requirement text.
- Each design identifier that names existing code matches the current source.
  Use `rg` to confirm exact symbols before the artifact is complete.
- New files do not copy the legacy `Migrated source detail` wrapper.
- New artifacts appear in the catalog command output for the owning system.
- Before adding prose to an existing specification, check its current byte
  count against the applicable limit in `structure-and-ownership.md`; keep
  enough headroom for the edit or split the document at a contract boundary.

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py
python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all
git diff --check -- docs/specs docs/decisions
```

If a file reaches its size limit, split it by capability, lifecycle, or contract
boundary. Do not add a size exception for a new document.

An existing `legacy_size_exceptions` value is a frozen ratchet. When a legacy
file grows, reduce or split the content and lower the exception to the resulting
exact byte size; never raise the ceiling merely to silence lint.

## Design-package behavior

When this skill runs inside `/spec-driven-development` or `/fix`, continue to
the system design, plan, and work orders. Stop after requirements only when the
user explicitly requests a requirements review or a material question blocks
safe design.

For a standalone specification request, report the changed paths, requirement
IDs, design references, validation results, and open questions. Then return
control to the user.
