# Code Review

Review the current changes in the codebase (Go backend + Vite/React SPA monorepo). Every finding needs a `file_path:line_number` reference, an explanation of *why* it matters, and a concrete fix.

Start from intent and evidence: read the spec/task first when available, then read tests before production code. Tests reveal the expected behavior and often expose whether the implementation is actually verified.

## Steps

### 1. Identify changed files and check scope

Determine the right diff scope:
- **Local changes**: `git diff --name-only` (unstaged) and `git diff --cached --name-only` (staged)
- **PR review**: `git diff origin/<base_branch>...HEAD --name-only` to diff against the base branch

Read each changed file in full — understand surrounding code, not just the diff. Navigate callers, interfaces, and tests to understand changes end-to-end.

For each file, identify which requirement or intent it serves. Flag any changes that don't map to the task — scope creep is a blocker.

### 2. Review tests and verification first

Before reviewing implementation details:
- Read changed tests and nearby existing tests.
- Check whether tests assert behavior, not implementation details.
- Check whether the selected test level is appropriate: unit for pure logic, integration for boundaries, E2E for critical browser flows.
- Identify missing coverage for happy path, key error paths, edge cases, auth/workspace boundaries, and concurrency/order-sensitive behavior.
- Treat missing tests for new or changed non-UI logic as a blocker unless the change is explicitly untestable and says why.

### 3. Review for issues

Check every changed file for the following layers. Skip layers that don't apply to the change.

**Security** (blockers if found):
- No secrets, tokens, or credentials in code
- Input validation at system boundaries (user input, API handlers, external data)
- No SQL injection, XSS, command injection, or path traversal risks
- Authentication and authorization checks in place for new endpoints
- No insecure crypto (MD5/SHA1 for passwords, weak random)
- Workspace and office boundaries are enforced; no cross-workspace data, credentials, logs, or agent context leakage
- Agent/tool execution is constrained by code, not prompt text alone

If the change is security-sensitive, recommend a `security-auditor` assignment
to the planner rather than spawning it from this worker.

**Architecture:**
- Frontend: no direct data fetching in components (must go through store), shadcn imports from `@kandev/ui` not `@/components/ui/*`
- Backend: provider pattern for DI, context passed through call chains, event bus for cross-component communication
- New abstractions justified — no over-engineering
- Concerns cleanly separated (single responsibility)

**Logic & correctness:**
- Edge cases handled (empty input, nil/null, zero, max values)
- Error paths covered and not silently swallowed
- Race conditions or concurrency issues in concurrent code

**Performance:**
- No N+1 queries (loop with individual DB calls)
- No memory leaks (unclosed connections, streams, listeners)
- Missing database indexes for new query patterns
- Algorithm complexity appropriate for the data scale

**Complexity limits** (CI also enforces these, but catch them early to avoid pushing and waiting):
- Go: functions <=80 lines, <=50 statements, cyclomatic <=15, cognitive <=30, nesting <=5
- TS: files <=600 lines, functions <=100 lines, cyclomatic <=15, cognitive <=20, nesting <=4
- If too large or complex, split into smaller cohesive files/functions

**Code quality:**
- No duplicated logic — extract shared helpers or constants
- No dead code, unused imports, or commented-out code
- Check for orphaned code: if the PR refactored or removed callers, grep for functions/types/exports that lost their last consumer
- No speculative code — unused flags/options, "reserved for future" scaffolding, one-off abstractions with a single call site, options parsed but never used
- Naming clear and consistent with project conventions
- Deep nesting (>3 levels) — use early returns

**AI slop detection:**
- Comments that restate code or narrate obvious steps
- Unnecessary try/catch that swallow errors or return silent defaults in trusted internal paths
- Redundant validation where inputs are already parsed/typed
- `as any` or `as unknown as X` casts used to dodge type errors instead of fixing types
- Defensive checks abnormal for the area of the codebase — compare with surrounding code patterns

**Testing:**
- Backend (Go): new or changed functions/methods must have corresponding tests
- Frontend (JS/TS libs only): new utility functions, hooks, API clients, and store slices must have tests
- We do NOT test React components — skip those
- Missing tests for changed logic are a blocker; suggest the exact behavior to cover and recommend the `test-engineer` subagent or `/tdd`

### 4. Report

Report every finding to the planner with a concrete suggested fix. Do not edit
the checkout or spawn a remediation worker.

### 5. Output

Use this format:

---

### Findings

#### Blocker (must fix before merge)
*Security holes, data loss risk, broken logic, crashes, missing tests for changed logic*

1. **[Title]** — `file.go:42`
   - Issue: what's wrong
   - Why: why it matters
   - Fix: concrete suggestion or code snippet

#### Suggestion (recommended, doesn't block)
*Performance problems, poor error handling, architectural concerns*

### Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Blocker | N |
| Suggestion | N |

**Verdict:** Ready to merge / Ready with suggestions / Blocked — fix blockers first

---

**Rules:**
- Only report findings you're >=80% confident about — quality over quantity
- Don't mark style preferences as blockers — linters cover formatting
- Every criticism needs a suggested fix
- Say when uncertain and recommend a specific investigation instead of guessing
- Don't give feedback on code you didn't read
- Omit empty severity sections

Do not spawn subagents. The planner owns remediation and follow-up review.

**Not a finding (skip these):**
- Pre-existing issues on lines the change didn't modify
- Things linters, typecheckers, or CI already catch (imports, types, formatting) — exception: still report complexity-limit violations since they require code changes to fix
